Nine adult immigrant ESL students were interviewed about their learning experiences. Creswell's (1994) systematic process informed the data analysis of the study. The findings of the study include adult immigrant learners' perspectives of the ESL program, the challenges (loads) they face in their daily lives in terms of learning and speaking English, the support system (power) that help them navigate through those difficulties, and their suggestions to improve the learning experiences at the ESL program. Implications of this research for policy, adult educators, curriculum, and program developers are explored.},

Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and an online survey and analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings revealed that combining socialization with varied speaking activities and incorporating popular culture topics relevant to students increased motivation, reduced the affective filter, boosted confidence, and improved fluency and accuracy. The integration of student interests and fostering of personal relationships promoted a holistic understanding of cognitive and metacognitive strategies, enhancing overall speaking skills. However, limitations include a small sample size from the same sociocultural context. Further research with a larger, more diverse sample is recommended for unbiased results. The study highlights the benefits of tailoring speaking activities to students' interests and encourages developing interpersonal relationships to facilitate language learning.},

	abstract = {This article reports a qualitative action research study regarding the influence of strategies that may be used in oral conversation to avoid communication breakdowns. After analyzing college students' performance in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classes, the problem was that many adult learners exhibited poor oral English communication skills, which negatively affected their exit examinations and opportunities to earn a degree. Grounded in sociocultural and cognitive load theories, the purpose of this study was to explore adult learners' perceptions at a private university in Northern Colombia regarding the influence of compensation strategies on their English-speaking skills. A purposive sample of 20 intermediate-level students was taught how to use circumlocution, approximation, coining words, and self-repetition to preclude communication breakdown caused by knowledge gaps. Data collection instruments included journal entries and transcriptions from semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed using thematic analysis aided by MAXQDA. The analysis discovered that compensatory strategies supported the enhancement of students' grammatical accuracy, fluency, and language learning motivation. Findings also showed that compensatory strategies did not influence the use of level appropriate vocabulary, and coining words was the least influential strategy. However, introducing the strategies helped reduce students' affective filter and boost their speaking performance. As a pedagogical implication, teachers should facilitate the intentional integration of compensation strategies to scaffold adult learners' confident and fluent communication.},

We collected data through pre-and post-student surveys, semi-structured interviews, self-reflection forms, and peer-evaluation forms. The pre-survey results revealed that the participants already held positive perceptions of oral presentations despite perceived difficulties. The post data showed significant changes in a positive direction in four variables, namely unwillingness, experience and perception of oral presentations, and language skills. The findings from the qualitative data also confirmed that the participants had benefited from their supervised oral presentations in terms of overcoming their speaking anxiety and perceived significant improvements in a range of language skills including pronunciation and public speaking.},

	abstract = {Flow has been identified as an optimal state of total immersion, enjoyment, and concentration with the appropriate balance of challenge and skills (Csíkszentmihályi, 1990) and an important factor contributing to improved task performance (Gregersen \& MacIntyre, 2014). However, despite its relevance, publications related to this aspect in the context of foreign language (FL) geragogy (i.e., FL learning and teaching of older adults), are still very scarce. To bridge this gap, the present research was undertaken with older adult English as a FL learners aimed at investigating task-specific flow and the corresponding range of emotions. The study employed a mixed-methods approach with two types of data collected in two stages. First, students of the University of the Third Age, representing A1 (n = 20) and A2+ (n = 18) proficiency levels (Council of Europe, 2001), were asked to complete a questionnaire after performing three different tasks during a regular lesson: a listening task, a grammar exercise, and an information gap speaking activity. The data collection instrument tapped into their enjoyment, anxiety, and flow. This was followed by semi-structured interviews with selected participants (n = 9). The results show that flow in the FL classroom is dynamic, and dependent on specific task characteristics, especially the arrangement mode and the level of other students' disruptive behaviors.},

	abstract = {The present study aims to investigate how social media can influence the development of oral skills in 60 students from a higher education institution in Peru. In this regard, mixed-methods research was conducted, with pre and post-tests, to evaluate the before and after of implementing a program that involved uploading videos recorded by the students on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Additionally, an effort was made to design a model that measured the relationship between the constructs of oral skills (OS), psychological aspects (PA), comment effects (CE), and social networks (SN). In the last stage of this work, a semi-structured interview aimed to gather students' opinions on social networks. Among the most relevant results, a significant difference can be mentioned after applying for the referred program, with a remarkable improvement in oral skills (pre-6.03± 2.30, post-16.85±1.38, p={\textless}0.01) with effect-size 0.9433. On the other hand, an appropriate model was obtained considering the constructs mentioned earlier (RMSEA 0.044; CFI 0.971; and TLI 0.963). Regarding the responses given by the interviewees, Facebook stands out as the most frequented social network by them, with a certain indifference to comments made by others, an improvement in their oral production, and a noticeable motivation. The results obtained in this work could help understand the complexity faced by today's youth and their learning on social media, as well as the possibility of replicating this at other educational levels in Peru.},

The participants who were purposively sampled to partake in the study included 105 second- and third-year undergraduates from various faculties who were enrolled in a functional reading course, of which 46 was assigned to the control group and 49 was treated as the experimental group. One-on-one and group oral assessments were administered to both groups at the end of the course after IRCT implementation. The results showed IRCT had a very positive effect on the oral communication skills of the students in the experimental group, significantly improving their confidence and motivation toward speaking English. The students' opinions from a questionnaire also revealed high speaking improvement, reinforced by evidence from close observations, interviews, and student work samples. IRCT was, therefore recommended as a reading-based approach to improving students' oral English communication.},

Positive effects of FCM have been recently discussed, but literature provides few empirical clues about whether FCM can actually enhance adult English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' oral proficiency. The researcher utilized FCM and Output-driven/Input-enabled model (Wen, 2008) in order to explore the advantages of FCM in terms of improving speaking skills. A pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design was utilized to examine the impact of FCM on speaking skills. The sample consisted of 22 non-English major voluntary academicians from different departments of a Turkish state university. There were 11 learners in class A (study group) where the course was flipped while the rest were in class B (control group) in which the courses were conducted in the traditional way. The researcher applied both qualitative and quantitative research methods and used multiple sources of data collection, including a speaking rubric, the teachers' in-class observations, two sets of questionnaires ("Satisfaction of FCM Experience" and "Opinions of Speaking"), and semi-structured focus-group interviews. Findings revealed that the use of flipped learning approach not only enhanced the speaking skill, but also increased learners' motivation and satisfaction with FCM. The results can be considered a reference point while designing oral skills in EFL contexts.},

	abstract = {Studying the factors of successful acquisition of ESL speaking skills in Ukrainian adult learners, the authors focused on the correlation between emotional intelligence and development of oral communication skills, and, on the other hand, on the growth of these indicators as a result of purposeful inclusion of content-related emotions into activities aimed at the development of speaking and listening skills. Theoretically based on the ideas of emotional intelligence as an important factor in human interaction and guided by the hypothesis that content-related emotions intensify emotional involvement and have a positive influence on the acquisition of oral communication skills, the researchers applied Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test and the English Language Oral Communication Skills Test developed by the authors, to measure the key oral communication skills indicators against a 100 point scale. Experimental teaching of 124 undergraduate students of International Relations during September 2018-May 2019 proved a beneficial influence of including emotions in the learning activities on the acquisition of ESL oral communication skills, as well as on student motivation and overall quality of student experiences. Significant increments in Emotional Intelligence and ESL oral communication skills in the experimental group compared to insignificant growth of the same indicators in the Reference group allow to establish a positive correlation between the growth of emotional intelligence and acquisition of the ESL speaking skills pursuant to inclusion of content-related emotions into the ESL learning in Ukrainian students.},

	abstract = {This study assesses the reasons behind learner dropout in adult EFL environments. Differences between two groups -- dropouts (N=154) and persistent learners (N=106) -- are examined using a questionnaire with qualitative and quantitative components. The study focussed on three areas: characteristics of the two groups (such as age and proficiency), their attitudes (self-efficacy, attitude to the language), and dropouts' perceptions of their language-learning experience. Significant differences were found in age and proficiency, among others, as well as in attitudes to the teacher and the language. When degree of demotivation is considered, further differences arise in attitudes to the course and in learners' perceived need to learn English for work. Dropouts tend to retain negative views of their teacher and of the course, showing that in-class factors are powerful demotives in adult language learning. Demotivated learners tended to attribute dropout to external factors, commonly mentioning poor teaching practice, a lack of speaking practice, and a discrepancy between their desired level and their perceived 'stagnant' level. The findings from this study inform teacher and administrator attitudes and behaviour in FL academies, helping them to identify learners who may be susceptible to, or who have already started down, the path to dropout.},

Moreover, it tests the pedagogy of adopting the strategy of Digital Story Telling (DST) in teaching English as a foreign language. The study is applied on Northern Boarder University as a case study. The first question raised in this study is whether the conventional methods of teaching are the reason behind their failure of speaking the English language and whether the modification in the pedagogy of teaching affects the learners' speaking skill. To this end, data are collected through a questionnaire. Furthermore, a model of a teaching program, based on using DST strategy, is improved and tested with a group of learners at the chosen university in Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal that the learners at the selected university find difficulty in speaking English, and that applying DST as a pedagogy help the students to develop their overall speaking skill. These findings assist EFL teachers in Saudi Arabia in creating a conducive atmosphere in and out their classes, which will motivate the learners a lot to speak English fluently. The conclusion of the research recommends that EFL teachers should modify their conventional methods of teaching English as a foreign language; they may apply the strategy of using DST on their students to test the competence of the hypothesis.},

This unique phenomenon leads me to observe and interview him to gain an answer to what factors which might affect him to do so and how that act will influence his speaking. The result shows that Richy's act was affected by cultural and psychological aspects where he got a pragmalinguistic failure in using his speech act of apology and tried to reach his need for safety through it.

	abstract = {In an era of major advances in the digital world, artificial intelligence has been a part of programs, tools, applications, and platforms. It has also been integrated into fields of education including language teaching and learning. To this end, ChatGPT, one of the most recent AI-driven systems, has been proposed to support language learners' personalized studies. Thus, this paper presents a qualitative study aiming to explore how Turkish EFL learners in higher education use ChatGPT for speaking. For a deeper understanding, the study was designed as a case study which used multiple sources to collect qualitative data. In this sense, semi-structured interviews were held with the participants, and through open-ended questions, they were asked about their study habits and any background knowledge about ChatGPT. In a following session, they were introduced the chatbot and instructed on possible ways to use it for speaking practice. Screen recordings of the usage by the participants were another source to observe and later describe the process for the researcher. A final session of the interviews planned as a stimulated recall was held to explore the participants' ChatGPT use experience through their reflection. The thematic analysis of the data revealed codes and themes leading to language teaching implications about learner characteristics and use of AI for language studies.},

	abstract = {Recently, chatbot interactions have been used for oral communication practice in the field of foreign language education. Some existing studies have highlighted the use of chatbots in relation to specific L2 skills, yet unfortunately, the user experience component of chatbot interaction has not been empirically researched. This study investigates the effect of chatbot-human interaction with the chatbot Replika on L2 speaking performance and speaking anxiety. The participants in the current study were 90 EFL students from a state university in Turkey. They used the application Replika for twelve weeks practicing targeted subjects outside the class. Each student was assessed with the L2 speaking anxiety scale both before and after the intervention. Also, an open-ended questionnaire was administered to collect their perceptions of using chatbots for L2 speaking practice. The interactions with the chatbot were screen taped for a randomly chosen speaking task: Well-being. The findings reveal that there were negative perceptions and attitudes toward the chatbot interaction. Students reported facing difficulties in being understood precisely, which might have contributed to higher anxiety in L2 speaking. Notably, student performance with Replika was significantly better than their face-to-face peer interactions. Overall, the results show that although chatbot interaction is a novel way to provide speaking practice for students, the actual interaction with a chatbot might not be a reliable way to lessen their anxiety with L2 speaking.},

	abstract = {Expressing thoughts and feelings efficiently is fundamental in daily, academic, and professional life. Accordingly, self-efficacy beliefs play pivotal roles in shaping learners' speaking performance through various dimensions. Higher education institutions assume responsibility for boosting students' speaking self-efficacy, thereby contributing to their self-confidence in different venues. Meanwhile, AI-integrated English classes are on the rise thanks to their overt advantages. In this regard, this study investigated the role of ChatGPT in improving speaking self-efficacy of EFL learners who were selected randomly among sophomore students in Advanced English classes at the tertiary level in Erbil, Iraq. Forty-four students whose ages ranged from 18 to 27 joined the study to represent the control or experimental group voluntarily within 8 weeks in the 2024-2025 academic year. Control group students took part in speaking sessions in classes, whereas experimental group students took advantage of ChatGPT as a speaking tutor to support their learning in classes with given topics in line with the coursebook. Data collection was implemented through speaking exams, questionnaires, and interviews, the analyses of which were conducted using SPSS 29 and MAXQDA. Findings unearthed that ChatGPT is a promising tool to increase students' speaking self-efficacy scores because it offers a welcoming atmosphere to receive constructive feedback, play recordings several times, and balanced instruction according to learners' levels. Thus, they could relieve speaking anxiety and speak more self-assuredly. The current study's findings may have varied reflections for interested parties engaged in integrating AI tools into speaking classes harmoniously.},

	abstract = {English language education in Japan has long been criticized for its traditional methods emphasizing grammar and reading at the expense of communicative competence. This article explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) to address this issue. A review of literature explored critical challenges faced by Japanese EFL learners, including Japanese teachers' low English proficiency and attitudes towards English teaching, heavy focus on entrance examinations in high school, overemphasis on grammar in EFL curricula and textbooks, lack of authentic communicative practice, and differences in cultural values. An examination of technology integration in Japanese education revealed that while many institutions have begun incorporating technology, its widespread adoption has been gradual. Several case studies support the use of AI to address the psychological barrier to speaking by offering a safe and engaging learning environment, thus boosting confidence and fluency. Furthermore, in the Japanese language context, AI can lower anxiety, promote creativity, and offer personalized learning. In addition to the individual benefits, AI empowers institutions to tailor learning needs, teachers to shift their role from instructors to facilitators, and students to become independent critical thinkers. Finally, challenges and limitations are addressed, including ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, overreliance, predictive patterns, and watermarking. Despite potential drawbacks, the benefits of AIEd merit a deeper exploration of its adoption in EFL curricula. AI tools offer a practical solution to prepare Japanese EFL students to communicate in English effectively and confidently and thus participate in the global landscape.},

	abstract = {In line with the rapid advancement in educational technology, and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in particular, the teaching and learning of the English language has undergone a significant transformation. This paper aims to explore students' perceptions of integrating AI into the English as a foreign language (EFL) learning process. To this aim, data were collected from 26 senior students in the Department of English Language Teaching at a state University in Türkiye through a background questionnaire and interviews. Findings revealed that utilization of AI language tools was advantageous in providing equality in learning opportunities, access to authentic materials, reduced reliance on traditional learning settings and instructors, access to accurate information, and supporting various learning activities such as receiving timely feedback, error correction, idea generation, planning, outlining, summarizing, paraphrasing, note-taking, and proofreading. It also offers advantages in improving pronunciation and fostering autonomous and adaptive learning, while also reducing anxiety. However, challenges associated with utilizing AI-powered tools include the presentation of inaccurate, artificial, and inauthentic information, incorrect statements, a lack of instructional guidance, a mechanical learning experience, hindrance to creative writing and speaking, and concerns over data privacy and security. Thus, reevaluating teachers' roles, enhancing digital literacy, intensifying the infrastructure for easier and more affordable access to AI tools, increasing expert guidance, and addressing privacy concerns are recommended in utilizing AI-powered tools in EFL settings.

The article reports on one classroom action research conducted on two groups of non-English-speaking university students. This present study investigates whether language proficiency plays a role and which stage of the OHE learning process deserves special attention. Different types of learning behaviors were found, and pedagogical implications that contribute to implementation of the approach are discussed. The paper argues that the OHE paradigm is not complete without immediate feedback, a component that has historically been impractical in formal EFL contexts and that AI-driven feedback should fill in the gap by enhancing the effectiveness of the lexical approach.},

	abstract = {Providing feedback on EFL Learners' speaking errors has been extensively researched, with numerous studies highlighting its benefits (Van Ha, et al., 2021; Hartono, 2022). This study investigates the impact of "pending feedback", a type of feedback where students must independently discover the correct answer. This research emphasizes the need for feedback in solidifying knowledge during targeted practice based on Skill Acquisition Theory (Dekeyser, 2020), which holds that language acquisition moves through declarative knowledge, proceduralization, and automatization phases; Furthermore, the sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978) guides this study and emphasizes the need for learner autonomy and interaction in supporting language development. Moreover, the study uses Schmidt's (1990) Noticing Hypothesis, which holds that cognitive awareness or "noticing" of language structures is necessary for language acquisition. Sixty IELTS learners, 30 in the experimental group and 30 in the control group, were recruited. Both groups displayed similar pre-test results. The experimental group received pending feedback, while the control group received teacher-selected feedback methods, excluding pending feedback. To find any possible significant difference in the group's performance and to detect the relation between pending feedback frequency of occurrence and the increased speaking scores in the experimental group, an Independent Sample t-test and Pearson correlation were conducted on two groups of participants. The experimental group improved IELTS speaking scores, indicating a strong correlation between pending feedback and better speaking performance. Additionally, the frequency of pending feedback was examined within the experimental group, further confirming that students who received more frequent pending feedback opportunities indicated enhanced performance.},

Internally, a learner's personality traits, such as self-inferiority, fear of making mistakes, lack of confidence, and their level of proficiency--including lack of vocabulary knowledge, grammatical inaccuracy, improper pronunciation, lack of skill in scriptwriting, and being unable to articulate things concisely--were major sources of anxiety. Externally, classroom activities, such as public speaking and impromptu speech activities, unclear explanations from teachers, and time constraints, also contributed to learners' anxiety. This study also showed that learners employed various techniques to reduce their anxiety, including preparation, relaxation, positive thinking, peer thinking and task-focused. This underscores the importance for teachers and companies to provide a learning environment appropriate for adult EFL learners and to equip them with tools to create an atmosphere that is less anxiety-inducing.},

	abstract = {Within the communicative language teaching approach, current instructional materials often lack explicit guidance or fail to provide L2 learners with a wide range of resources in the target language. Conversation analysis (CA), which focuses on authentic talk, has been proposed as a potential resource for language classrooms. This study examines the effectiveness of using CA as a pedagogical approach in an EFL classroom and its impact on learners' attitudes toward English language learning. The study engaged eight adult learners in a structured program, encompassing a pre-test, a 4-week explicit CA-informed instruction, and a post-test. After four weeks, learners demonstrated progress in their knowledge and skills of interaction, different aspects of English speaking, interactional competence, and confidence in speaking English. Additionally, the CA-informed instruction positively influenced learners' attitudes toward English language learning and their appreciation of interactional features. The results strongly suggest that language teachers should consider incorporating CA insights into their teaching practices to enhance both linguistic and attitudinal outcomes.},

The focus of this article is to describe an exploratory single case study of the instructional practices used by teachers in a nonacademic adult English as a second language (NAESL) program. Specifically, the study looked at vocabulary instruction teachers employed with beginner-level adult ESL students. The data was collected using questionnaires, classroom observations, and post-observation interviews with the teachers. The findings show that teachers used two categories of activities to teach vocabulary: oral vocabulary activities and written vocabulary activities. It is significant that not only did the participants use twice as many written vocabulary activities as oral vocabulary activities in their NAESL classrooms, but they did not identify written vocabulary activities and oral vocabulary activities as addressing different language skills. Considering the importance of listening and speaking as entry-level language skills, NAESL teachers need to become aware of the importance of the distinction between these two types of instructional activities and the need to focus more instructional time to building and strengthening listening and speaking as these basic, necessary communication skills.},

Carrying out text analyses of authentic materials in the ESL classroom can also help students become more critical in their approach to reading. Grounded in systemic functional linguistics (SFL) concepts, this paper puts forward a series of text analysis tasks, so ESL teachers can introduce their adult students to the concepts of transitivity and intentionality found in opposing newspaper articles dealing with conflict. Overall, these analyses show how the active voice can highlight the semantic value of intentionality via material processes, and how writers use strategies such as passivization and fronting of items in clauses to emphasize the responsibility for wrongdoing when reporting news. The analyses also show that context is important in determining degrees of intentionality, and intentionality can be attributed to the material processes of human actors portrayed as non-human actors. Understanding these concepts can help adult ESL students become better critical readers/thinkers.},

Immense difficulties were produced in the collision between a biological hazard (the novel coronavirus) and the power-inflected social structures that organize language teaching in different locales. In this paper I explore some impacts of the pandemic on three instructors in the single largest adult ESL program in Canada, Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC). Grounded in an account of the historical origins and development of the LINC program, a reflexive thematic analysis of instructor responses to vignettes of resonant challenges identified three major issues that were intensified by the pandemic: navigating digital inequities, balancing the teaching of digital literacies and language teaching in an accountability framework, and managing boundaries and expectations. These results are contextualized in the larger conversations around LINC and adult ESL programming globally, and some implications and new directions for the post-pandemic landscape now visible on the horizon are also considered.},

The participants belonged to a blended-flipped program of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). E-Forum posting in the course aimed at encouraging beginner learners to exchange experiences; however, participation in the e-forums did not evolve into spontaneous interactions. Therefore, authentic tasks were designed and implemented in the e-forum. Data were gathered from learners' participation registers, surveys, and interviews and by executing a content-analysis procedure. After analyzing the data, one main category and three subcategories emerged. The main category showed that implementing authentic tasks on students' e-forums interactions led to the collaborative construction of a cognitive-social e-learning environment. The main category comprised three subcategories: (a) building a learning community by interweaving affective-communicative actions, (b) promoting an online learning environment through authenticity, and (c) moving from individual to collective knowledge construction. Findings suggest that the implementation of authentic tasks on e-forums: (a) increased learners' meaningful interactions mediated by social, cognitive, and teaching presences; (b) helped to construct significant and lifelong knowledge collectively; and (c) fostered a stronger learning community through participants' affective-communicative actions.},

	abstract = {This study investigated whether task complexity may affect L2 speaking performance as predicted by the Cognition Hypothesis (Robinson, 2011), and whether the effect of task complexity may interact with individual differences in working memory capacity. A total of twenty Korean advanced-level EFL learners performed two separate picture description tasks, which were different in task complexity along [+/- here and now] dimension. Their working memory was measured by an L1 version of a reading span task. The results showed that there was no significant difference between Here-and-Now task (i.e., a simple task) and There-and-Then task (i.e., a complex task) in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency of English speaking performance, rejecting the prediction of the Cognition Hypothesis. Yet, it found that working memory correlated with accuracy in L2 performance on the complex task, but not on the simple task. This indicates that the effect of individual learners' working memory capacity is observable only when a task demands a high control of attentional resources. Conversely, when a task is simple, individual differences in working memory capacity do not result in significant differences in L2 speaking performance.},

Based on the findings, it has been identified that learners use language learning strategies in order to become good language learners. The respondents have pretty much the same preferences in using the language learning strategies. However, although different learners preferred different language learning strategies, there are some strategies that are leading among good language learners. All of the respondents tend to make use of all three categories of language learning strategies which are cognitive, meta-cognitive and socio affective.

Flipped learning, or inverted learning, reverses the traditional educational model where students learn in class and practice out of it; flipped learning promotes the students' learning of concepts and theories out of the classroom that is later practiced and applied in class under the teacher's guidance. The primary hypothesis was that by flipping grammar explanations, students would be more prepared and have more time to interact in English and use the structures in class. This research revealed that flipped learning helped to increase student talking time in class and accuracy in grammar use. Furthermore, it shows evidence that using flipped audiovisual materials poses advantages and challenges that can potentially boost learning inside and outside the classroom.},

After experiencing a two-semester of CAPT instruction in their Freshman English course, students completed a questionnaire to assess their perceptions of and attitudes towards technology. This paper reports on the findings that examine the structural relationships using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The findings indicate that students, generally, were in favor of using ASR-based pronunciation training, and although no statistically significant gender difference was found, female students appeared to view its use more favorably than were their male counterparts. The perceived effectiveness of the system, and the attitudes of students towards using it, were shown to be significantly correlated, which encourages the ongoing use of ASR-based CAPT. Based on these responses, it was established that the ASR function enhanced students' awareness of their pronunciation errors. Furthermore, they willingly engaged in individual, repetitive pronunciation exercises, allowing them to build confidence in speaking practices without fearing embarrassment in front of their peers. Recommendations were provided for EFL educators interested in implementing CAPT in EFL settings.},

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of three modern ASR dictation software programs with young Taiwanese learners of English. Capabilities of these ASR applications were also explored by assessing whether the transcription accuracy of high and low proficiency learners' can be differentiated. Thirty junior high school students dictated the same 60 sentences used in Derwing et al.'s (2000) original dictation study, and their outputs were further analyzed. The results indicated that the transcription accuracy rates of high proficiency learners were comparable to the accuracy rates of native English speakers in previous studies, suggesting that current dictation programs have become more accurate in transcribing non-native speech. Results also show that low proficiency learners' accuracy rates were significantly lower compared to high proficiency learners, indicating that the programs were able to differentiate proficient and less proficient learners.},

	abstract = {This study looked at how practically ASR-based interactive video assignments can be integrated into EFL classrooms for additional out-of-class speaking practice, and what effects it will have on students. We created an ASR-based interactive video assignment using Google Scripts and gave it to students as a homework assignment between lessons in which students were learning to give opinions and respond to interrogatives. We used pre- and post-treatment surveys to examine shifts in students' attitudes and gather their responses pertaining to the interactive video assignment. In general, students thought the assignment was good practice, and the majority of students showed positive shifts in confidence and feelings of liking English (p {\textless} 0.001 for both, rs = 0.28 and rs = 0.48, respectively). However, we found that students overfocused on pronunciation, especially when they were more proficient learners (p = 0.035, r = 0.015). Therefore, we believe that while the activity was somewhat successful, the feedback likely needs to be changed for ASR-based systems when the focus should not be pronunciation. Future possibilities are also discussed.},

The automatic speech recognition technique (ASR) provides students with instantaneous feedback and interactive oral practice for supporting a context with self-paced learning. Corrective feedback (CF) should be combined with ASR-based systems to enhance students' speaking performance, and to reduce their cognitive load. However, learners' perceptions of CF are mixed, and CF might give rise to learning anxiety. In this study, a dynamic assessment-based speech recognition (called DA-SR) learning system was designed to facilitate students' English speaking. Moreover, a quasi-experiment was implemented to evaluate the effects of the proposed approach on students' speaking learning effectiveness, via respectively providing the DA-SR and the corrective feedback-based speech recognition (called CF-SR) approaches for the experimental and control groups. The experimental results revealed that both the DA-SR group and the CF-SR group can effectively improve the students' English speaking skills, and decrease their English speaking learning anxiety. Moreover, this study further demonstrated that the DA-SR approach successfully reduced students' English class performance anxiety, and extraneous cognitive load in comparison with the CF-SR approach. It could be a valuable reference for designing English speaking learning activities in EFL learning environments.},

Nevertheless, read-aloud is still treated as a useful approach in English classes for speech pronunciations in particular in Asia. This study aims at the design of a system that uses a robot as a tutor equips automatic speech recognition to diagnose learners' errors while they are reading aloud the English passages. The learner is able to practice and improve pronunciations via the diagnosis. An experiment designed with a pretest, a posttest, and a delayed posttest was conducted to evaluate the proposed robot-tutoring system. 19 university students in Taiwan enrolled in the experiment, and learned with the system for 90 minutes per round, with a total of 2 rounds of self-learning. The results showed the participants' accuracy of read-aloud in the delayed posttest was significantly better than those of the pretest and immediate posttest. In addition, when looking into the investigation of the participants' perceptions of the system, most were impressed by the system, and also agreed the system was a useful and helpful tool to help reading English passages aloud. Therefore, this study provides evidence of the effects of robot-tutoring approach on adults' English read-aloud in Taiwan.},

With automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) have potential in foreign language interaction applications. Further empirical research is required to validate the usefulness of IPA interactions in improving EFL speaking skills. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of IPAs, especially IPA feedback presentation mode, on adolescent EFL learners' speaking proficiency. A total of 88 ninth-grade EFL learners were recruited from three intact classes and randomly divided into two experimental groups (i.e., one using Google Home Hub with multimodal feedback and one using Google Home Mini with audio feedback only) and one control group (that interacted with a teacher and peers in a conventional classroom). Both quantitative (English speaking test results) and qualitative data (semi-structured interview responses) were collected and analyzed in the 10-week study. The results revealed that interacting with Google Assistant through Google Home Hub improved the adolescent EFL learners' speaking proficiency most markedly. Detailed analyses of the participants' interviews demonstrated that IPA-mediated interaction (1) added variety and enjoyment to EFL speaking, (2) expanded exposure to English and learner-centered speaking practice with immediate feedback, (3) offered greater authenticity and flexibility in interactions, and (4) encouraged peer collaboration. Furthermore, multimodal presentation of IPA feedback was superior to single-mode presentation in enhancing EFL speaking proficiency. The narration, on-screen text, and graphics were crucial to the EFL learners' successful interaction with the IPA.},

To enhance the effectiveness of GenAI-powered English-speaking instruction and the learning experience, this study expands on the Integrated Model of Technology Acceptance (IMTA) by investigating the role of various emotions and willingness to communicate in different contexts as intrinsic motivators for the acceptance of GenAI-powered conversational chatbots. Using a questionnaire (n = 368) and pre- and post-tests, the study found that EFL learners with higher communicative confidence and greater foreign language learning boredom tend to perceive GenAI chatbots as less useful for developing speaking skills. While GenAI successfully aided them in improving their speaking skills through both theme-based and free dialogues, learners who are more willing to engage in face-to-face interactions with peers and teachers may not find chatbots as productive or engaging as human counterparts. The results suggest that EFL teachers should be aware of the limitations of GenAI and students' individual differences, integrating GenAI into their classrooms in a way that aligns with student's proficiency and preferences to create a harmonious and efficient GenAI-supported language learning environment.

	abstract = {One of the biggest challenges for EFL (English as Foreign Language) students to learn English is the lack of practicing environments. Although language researchers have attempted to conduct flipped classrooms to increase the practicing time in class, EFL students generally have difficulties interacting with peers and teachers in English in class. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides an opportunity to address this problem. With AI technologies, computer systems, in particular in the form of AI chatbots, are able to identify the meanings of users' statements and make responses accordingly. In the research design, AI-based chatbots were employed in the in-class and out-of-class activities for facilitating the students' speaking performance and interactions during the learning process in a university flipped English speaking classroom. The experimental results show that the mind map-guided AI chatbot approach (MM-AI) promoted the students' English speaking performances more than did the conventional AI chatbot approach (C-AI). Moreover, the MMAI also promoted the students' learning performance and organized the interaction between the robots and humans more than the C-AI did. The findings could be a valuable reference for language educators and researchers who intend to conduct AI-supported flipped classrooms in language learning.},

	abstract = {ChatGPT, a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot capable of providing personalised responses to users' inquiries, recently has had a substantial impact on education. Many studies have explored the use of ChatGPT in English as a second language (ESL) and English as a foreign language (EFL) education since its release on 30 November 2022. However, there has been a lack of systematic reviews summarising both the current knowledge and the gaps in this research area. This systematic review analyses 70 empirical studies related to the use of ChatGPT in ESL/EFL education within a 1.5-year period following its release. Using the Technology-based Learning Model, we provide a comprehensive overview of the domains in which ChatGPT has been applied, the methodological approaches, and associated research issues. The included studies collectively provide solid evidence regarding the affordances (e.g., increased learning opportunities, personalised learning, and teacher support) and potential drawbacks (e.g., incorrect information, privacy leakage, and academic dishonesty) of ChatGPT use in ESL/EFL education. However, our findings indicate that the majority of studies have focused on students' use of this AI tool in writing, while few studies have quantitatively examined its effects on students' performance and motivation. In addition, the impact of ChatGPT on other language skills, such as reading, speaking, and listening, remains under-researched. Therefore, we recommend that longer-term studies with rigorous research designs (e.g., quasi-experimental designs) and objective data sources (e.g., standardised tests) be conducted to provide more robust evidence regarding the influence of ChatGPT on students' English language acquisition.},

It is an innovative approach to future learning, including in the English as a Second Language (ESL) classroom. Since its inception, ChatGPT has been remarkably used by most educators and learners. Nevertheless, its application in the flipped classroom, especially in enhancing ESL learners' speaking skills, is notably an innovative and novel phenomenon. Besides, educators' challenges in giving instant feedback to learners and creating an engaging learning environment in the flipped classroom emerged as a crucial consideration. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT as a partnering tool in developing ESL learners' speaking skills in the flipped classroom setting in a Malaysian public university. This study also scrutinises ESL learners' challenges in using ChatGPT to develop speaking skills. The researchers employ a mixed-method design incorporating a five-point Likert scale questionnaire and focus group interviews. The quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics, while the qualitative data was analysed through thematic analysis. The findings of this study offer significant implications for various stakeholders in the educational industry. Policymakers, course designers, educators, learners, and even the Ministry of Education will obtain valuable insights, especially in decision-making, innovative teaching approaches, and learners' speaking abilities in the ESL flipped classroom.},

Data collected from 332 Chinese EFL learners (159 on-campus and 173 on-job learners) were analysed by using structural equation modelling. Results indicated that Chinese EFL learners perceived AI affordances to be significant in influencing their emotional, cognitive and behavioural engagement in practicing their spoken English. The results from the PLS-SEM model revealed that AI affordances accounted for 54.7\%, 52.4\% and 56.0\% of the variance in emotional engagement, cognitive engagement and behavioural engagement, respectively. Learner type was not found to significantly moderate the relationships between AI affordances and speaking engagement. Gender was found to be a significant moderator for the AI affordances--behavioural engagement and AI affordance--cognitive engagement relationships. These findings enrich existing literature about AI--empowered speaking engagement and provide practical implications for English teachers to design effective speaking-teaching models.},

Therefore, this article intends to analyze an AI speech evaluation system for English speaking practice, in the context of higher education through the IMTA. Research instruments encompassed questionnaires (n = 218) and semi-structured interviews (n = 21). The participants were English as a foreign language (EFL) learners who had used an AI speech evaluation program to practice their speaking skills. The results suggested that (1) most participants found the AI program useful, pleasant, and easy to use. They also had a strong intention to continue using it; (2) perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived enjoyment (PE) are significant predictors of behavioural intention to use (BI). Meanwhile, problems related to user interface design, the accuracy of automatic feedback and especially the lack of face-to-face interaction were reported. This study demonstrates how IMTA could be applied to examine users' acceptance of AI programs for EFL speaking practice. The findings also offer insights into further research and development in AI tools for EFL speaking practice.},

	abstract = {Flipped learning is gaining prominence in EFL classrooms, where it has been shown to provide various advantages. However, the literature has not adequately addressed the integration of L2 interaction outside the classroom into flipped learning design. Accordingly, given the ubiquitous and interactive nature of chatbot technology, we designed a chatbot-assisted flipped approach to increase learners' opportunities for L2 practice. To examine the impact of this approach, we investigated how the use of chatbots as conversational partners in the out-of-class phase of flipped learning affected students' interactive performance and perceptions of interaction. We randomly assigned 87 elementary school EFL learners to experimental (n = 42) and control (n = 45) groups. For six weeks, both groups were taught using the same flipped approach except that after viewing a video, the experimental students practiced a pre-class dialogue with chatbots while the control group practiced the dialogue using a worksheet. Employing a sequential, explanatory mixed-methods design, we collected two sets of quantitative data (pre- and post-interactive speaking tests and an interaction questionnaire) and one set of qualitative data (semi-structured interviews). The quantitative data analyses showed that the experimental group outperformed the control group in terms of interactive speaking performance and the degree to which they perceived they had participated in learner-learner and learner-instructor interactions. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data supplemented the quantitative results by elucidating how the chatbots facilitated the learners' interactive speaking performance and perceptions of interaction. This study highlights the potential of chatbot technology to bridge the out-of-class and in-class phases of flipped learning.},

To investigate potential effects of the bilingual practice on the learners' self-efficacy, a self-efficacy scale of English was administered before and after the 14-week course. Interviews were conducted to triangulate the results of the comparative analysis of the self-efficacy scale. The analysis revealed that only five out of 25 students' self-efficacy perceptions (related to speaking and writing) changed significantly with moderate effect size. The findings from the interviews suggest that changes in self-efficacy were only partly associated with the implementation of bilingual activities, and that unfavourable conditions of the course context overshadowed potential positive effects of the bilingual practice. However, the results also indicate that the bilingual practice was perceived conducive to L2 learning and that it may serve as a tool to addresses the specific needs of learners with diminished self-efficacy.},

The study employed a mixed method design, and the data were collected from 182 EFL learners at a higher education institution in Türkiye. The data were analysed through descriptive statistics and content analyses. The results demonstrated that the majority of the participants use mobile phones besides computers and tablets. However, their level of frequency in using these digital devices in English signaled a low level. Furthermore, results in association with the self-directed practices of learners for improving language skills evinced distinct language learning practices supported by technology-mediated applications and platforms. It was also concluded that learners need a well-organised self-directed learning practice in digital platforms.

To enrich such methods of assessment, a mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) technique was adopted in a classroom formative assessment for holistic language proficiency of listening, vocabulary, and grammar to determine whether it would make a difference in results. For fourteen weeks, this quasi-experiment consisting of a pre-post-test one group design was carried out over two cycles of seven weeks each, with 598 participants. During the experiment, students practiced formative assessment conventionally during the first cycle, while this assessment was done with the medium of two mobile apps: Kahoot! and Quizizz during the second cycle. The results of the Oxford Placement Test (OPT), replicated as the pre-test and post-test, indicated that mobile-assisted formative assessment resulted in a statistically-significant positive influence of using mobile apps on students' overall language proficiency.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the strategies employed by Vietnamese EFL teachers to enhance emotional intelligence (EI) in adult learners within online learning environments. Utilizing a qualitative research design grounded in Mayer and Salovey's model of emotional intelligence and Knowles's theory of andragogy, the study involved semi-structured interviews with ten EFL teachers from two Vietnamese educational institutions. The thematic analysis of the interview data revealed several key strategies: reflective practices, interactive activities, technology integration, personalized feedback, collaborative learning, integration of real-life scenarios, self-awareness activities, development of emotional vocabulary, and creation of emotionally supportive environments. The findings illustrate a multifaceted approach to enhancing EI in online language education, highlighting the innovative adaptation of traditional classroom strategies to the digital realm. The study's unique contribution lies in its focus on the Vietnamese context, providing insights into how cultural nuances shape online teaching strategies for EI enhancement. The implications of these findings are significant for the field of EFL education, suggesting the need for holistic teaching approaches that integrate emotional competencies alongside linguistic skills.},

The academic journals, in paper as well as electronic forms, are the most used channels of academic communication among researchers, due to the confidence that this information resource enjoys and the standards it applies. In addition, new ideas and developments appear in academic journals long before the books refer to them. Articles, topics, and issues of concern are published in them that do not appear in book form. In this background, this study investigates the research trends in 179 ESL/EFL published studies in "ELT Journal" and "TESOL Quarterly," journals that are acclaimed universally as the setters of research benchmarks. Results show that the focus subjects in these classify into subcategories (trends) which include Global English and Lingua Franca, learner's issues, teacher's issues, cultural perspectives, assessment issues, and ESL research methodology and Multimedia \& ICT in Language Education. Noticeably, researchers preferred to qualitatively study the Teaching Practices and Methods (f=43) and Global English and Lingua Franca (f=39). However, gaps are perceptible in the ongoing trends to fill which the study makes certain recommendations in its conclusion.},

	abstract = {This study employed qualitative analysis to investigate the technology anxiety experienced by Iranian EFL teachers conducting online classes, taking into account their digital literacy levels. A digital literacy questionnaire was administered to a group of EFL teachers teaching English online at two branches of a language institute in Iran using the virtual classroom software BigBlueButton. Based on the questionnaire responses, 12 teachers were categorized as high (N = 6) and low (N = 6) digital literates. Through semi-structured interviews and reflective journals, the study delved into teachers' anxiety regarding online teaching, identifying three primary types of anxiety: pedagogical anxiety, technological anxiety, and social anxiety. The findings revealed that pedagogical anxiety stemmed from disruptions in teaching and learning processes, technological anxiety arose from challenges such as internet disconnections, and social anxiety related to judgments based on technological proficiency. While effective language instruction was a shared concern among high and low digital literate teachers, their approaches to managing anxiety varied significantly. High digital literate teachers demonstrated greater resilience in addressing online teaching challenges, whereas low digital literate teachers experienced reduced confidence and struggled with virtual classroom management. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing technology-related anxiety among language teachers in online education to enhance teaching efficacy and student outcomes. It suggests integrating digital literacy courses and providing expert support to alleviate teaching and technology-related anxiety and stress among EFL teachers, leading to more effective teaching practices.},

	abstract = {The last few years have amplified the use of digital technology in the second language (L2) classroom due to the emergence of COVID-19. Students were forced to study online, and, as a result, changing the interaction among students became crucial. While most English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) classrooms have since returned to face-to-face delivery, many providers are now considering the potential benefits of online learning and the strategies that make the platform and classroom interaction effective. One method of facilitating online interaction is collaborative writing (i.e., co-writing). Co-writing refers to two or more individuals producing work and contributing to a task together. While not a new phenomenon in face-to-face settings, this research project closely investigates the methods that students use to interact while completing co-writing tasks in an online environment and the impact these may have on L2 learning. The data, taken over five weeks, was collected from 15 adult English for Academic Purposes students in an online ELICOS classroom. Results showed areas of improvement in co-writing and a perception among students that co-writing was helpful. The paper aims to contribute to greater understanding and improved co-writing delivery and practice for ESL students and practitioners.},

To this end, the authors assigned 26 learners from an English institute to the flipped and conventional groups. They adopted a two-group counterbalanced design in this research. In the flipped classroom, the teacher posted the course materials via "Telegram" in advance to the class. Inside the classroom, the participants engaged in various peer and group activities including precommunicative sentence arrangement, communicative tasks, pair, and group discussion, roleplay and storytelling. The data were from multiple data sources including a vocabulary knowledge test, a student-recorded portfolio and interviews. The results revealed that the participants performed better in the conventional classroom than the flipped learning classroom. However, they did not have positive attitudes toward inverted learning. The authors presented insights into the impacts of flipped instruction on the quality of vocabulary learning and offered recommendations and implications for future practice.},

The current study explores the use of the needs assessment, which measured instructors' beliefs following the sudden transition to online learning during the pandemic, and their awareness of principles of teaching and learning for EFL learners in particular within the context of Kurdistan Iraq. There are opportunities in and beyond the current setting to address issues of equity, capacity for integrating tech skills with pedagogy, and more empathy between public and private institutions of higher education that support EFL learners.

Using course outlines from ESL teacher training programs, a Likert-­scale questionnaire was developed and delivered to 108 experienced ESL teachers in six states of Australia. Exploratory factor analysis of the data identified seven types of knowledge differently valued by ESL teachers--namely knowledge of practice, learners, resources and technology, curriculum, contextual factors, language learning theories, and language components. The overarching term for the first four used in the study is knowledge of teaching and the overarching term used for the last three is knowledge of language. Teachers regarded knowledge of teaching as significantly more important than knowledge of language.},

	abstract = {Based on a prior study by Zubenko and Shwedel (2019), the present study investigated the possible effects of repetition (repeated exposure) on the incidental acquisition and retention of 120 English target words by 51 Ukrainian-speaking ESL learners at a Ukrainian university. The hypothesis was that regular repetition of vocabulary while incidental listening would have a significant and positive effect on students' vocabulary acquisition and performance. The paper examines the results of the implementation of spaced repetition of L2 vocabulary strategy of the second-year students who were covering the same vocabulary they learned during the experiment in the previous year. 7 audio lessons were created for increasing the long-term retention of target vocabulary in the students' memory. Participants (N=51) were second-year Ukrainian university students majoring in English as a second language (ESL) at the age of 17-19. They were assigned to three groups, one experimental and two comparison. The optimal result based on the interval of repetitions influences the vocabulary recall and retention. Students who used the spaced L2 vocabulary acquisition strategy (SVAS) outperformed on the End-of-Experiment test 84,1 versus 80,6 for the Comparison group. The results prove that spaced L2 vocabulary acquisition strategy is an efficient part of enriching new vocabulary. The findings indicate that implications of this research are connected with the spaced vocabulary acquisition strategy as an effective tool for learning new lexical units by ESL learners while incidental listening to the audio dictionary lessons. Thus, the study results open up new possibilities for the teachers and learners to consider implementing audio dictionaries and similar tools as assets for efficient vocabulary learning.},

	abstract = {Students' EFL learning experience in the rural context is poorer in comparison to urban quality of education. More than 70\% of students at the State Agrarian and Engineering University in Podillia are from rural areas. To reduce rural-urban disparities in academic learning the university teachers should use high-quality instruction techniques that can make the process of studying both effective and motivating. The traditional methods of EFL teaching no longer satisfy the needs of modern society. Hence, technology applications need a theoretical foundation based on experimental surveys to determine the strategies for effective EFL learning. This research paper was conducted to examine the possibility of utilising such MALL technology like Quizlet in improving EFL learners' vocabulary acquisition. A brief review of scholarly literature published from 2005-2019 on Quizlet implementation in foreign language learning showed that there are many studies on the benefits of using Quizlet in EFL vocabulary acquisition. However, the research papers on the principles and strategies for adequate Quizlet-based learning in Ukrainian higher educational institutions are still lacking. Pre- and post-experimental questionnaires, pre- and post-experimental tests were adopted as tools for data collection. The results of the experiment have proven the proposed hypothesis. After utilising Quizlet and using spaced repetition technique for vocabulary learning to prepare undergraduates to state English exam, the results proved that the learners of the experimental group improved their level of EFL vocabulary at the post-test.},

	abstract = {In exam-oriented English as a Foreign Language (EFL) foundation program, achieving a balance between high-stakes testing and skill-based learning remains a challenge. This study examines the limited efficacy of timed reading activities (TRAs) in contexts where students prioritize test preparation over fluency-building practices. In line with the license fashion of today, we provide a "reading license" as incentive to attract EFL students' attention to TRAs manifested in the Reading Power 1 textbook. In doing so, we aligned the processes of TRAs with those of obtaining a driving license. Accordingly, this study examines the effectiveness of the reading license technique on reading comprehension and reading speed among EFL students. Using a post-experimental research design, 85 students were recruited for this study. The study oriented the students on the process of getting a reading license. With these students, the first author used the reading license technique for one semester during which reading speed and reading comprehension were scaffolded with high-stakes tests. Then, five TRAs, with a corpus of 2000 words, were used to examine the comprehension level and reading speed among the students using the reading license technique to teach TRAs. The results showed that students achieved very good scores (a mean of 3.16 out of 5) and high reading speed (173.29 words per minute) using this technique. The results recommend that investing students' background knowledge such as the processes of getting a driving license with TRAs is a great scaffolding strategy to motivate students and enhance reading comprehension and reading speed. This study contributes to teaching techniques for TRAs in the context of high-stakes tests.},

However, with the changes to a more communication-focused English curriculum in the last few decades, this is no longer the norm. This paper will first review the reactions to communication-focused English instructions in Japan and other parts of Asia, then discuss the current study which explored the grammatical accuracy and fluency of spoken English production of 45 Japanese university EFL learners who had studied under the communication-focused curriculum in junior and senior high schools. The results of the study showed that, as a group, the participants were neither accurate nor fluent. Although some participants were able to produce sentences accurately using easier grammar structures, their production was very slow, indicating the retrieval of declarative knowledge instead of proceduralized knowledge. Literature review and the results of this current study suggest that the communication-focused curriculum has not been successful in developing fluency among Japanese English learners and that their accuracy has suffered from the decreased amount of grammar instructions. Instead of switching the focus from grammar to communication, balanced grammar instruction and fluency practice are needed.},

All interactions were audio-recorded and the transcripts were analyzed to determine how accurately and fluently the students produced relative clauses before, during, and after the practice activities. Whereas accuracy was defined as errors involving relative clause formation, fluency was operationalized in terms of the number of pauses, false starts, and self-corrections that occurred within relative clauses. The results showed that the students produced significantly more accurate relative clauses on the posttest; however, their production of dysfluencies remained unchanged. Implications for the use of interactive activities are discussed.},

Although AI has made advancements in this area, the standard SLA systems that are familiar with often fail to provide real-time, personalized feedback that can enhance language proficiency. This gap needs to be addressed with a more adaptive, data-driven approach. This study presents the Intelligent Galactic swarm optimized feedforward neural network (IGSO\_FNN) method to improve SLA. Integrating GSO with feedforward neural networks (FNN) solves the issue of learning weights and model parameters, increasing accuracy and personalizing the language learning experience. IGSO significantly improves the model's adaptability, particularly in model training when dealing with complex linguistic data. The dataset contains text and speech data of vocabulary usage, pronunciation accuracy, and grammatical patterns from varying proficiency levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the IGSO-FNN approach outperforms the traditional method, with learners benefiting from increased accuracy (97\%), precision (95\%), F1 score (93\%), recall (96\%), and MSE (0.04). The IGSO-FNN method is a scalable, adaptive solution to enhance SLA with real-time feedback and personalized learning paths.},

This qualitative study explored the experiences of Vietnamese learners in acquiring English, focusing on the influence of negative L1 transfer. This study focused on the influence of negative transfer from their first language (L1) by drawing upon in-depth interviews and observational data from a group of Vietnamese university students. The results showed that despite exhibiting high levels of motivation and enthusiasm for learning English, Vietnamese learners struggled with the shadows of L1 interference in areas such as pronunciation, syntax, and idiomatic expressions. The tonal nature of the Vietnamese language led to intonation patterns in English that deviated from native norms. Direct translations also contributed to unidiomatic English, indicating a deep influence of L1 thought patterns. Additionally, cultural contexts embedded within the Vietnamese language presented challenges, as some concepts and expressions lacked direct English equivalents. Although students faced various obstacles, they utilized a variety of adaptive techniques to lessen the impact of negative transfer. These techniques included code-switching, peer correction, and self-reflection. The study emphasized the significance of recognizing and comprehending the significant role of L1 when creating English language educational programs and teaching techniques for Vietnamese students. By illuminating the specific challenges and adaptive strategies of these learners, educators could personalize their approaches, leading to a more comprehensive and efficacious language-learning atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The use of grades as an extrinsic motivator in formal schooling has been demonstrated in previous research to have negative implications for students' learning and mental health. This subject matter has been particularly absent from the research literature in Vietnam, where the obsession with grades is self-evident. The present study aims to explore Vietnamese university students' orientations toward learning and grades, learning strategy use, mental well-being, and how these variables correlate. In addition, the study examines the potential interplay between learning orientation and grade orientation to influence the latter two variables. A quantitative research design was employed to achieve these goals. Survey responses were collected from 38 second- and third-year students majoring in English Language at a large, public university during a summer semester. Specifically for learning strategy use, participants were directed to pull from their experiences in a Public Speaking course that they had completed in the previous semester. Results revealed that a learning orientation was moderately related to both adaptive learning strategy use and mental wellness, whereas a grade orientation was only negatively related to learning strategy use and unrelated to mental well-being. Moreover, a strong learning orientation alone resulted in the most positive outcomes for both learning and mental health, and higher levels of grade orientation weakened those outcomes. Limitations of the study, directions for future research in this area, and implications for students and educators are then discussed.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, there has been a great deal of interest in language MOOCs (LMOOCs) and their potential to offer learning opportunities for large audiences, including those in disadvantaged communities. However, experiences and research have shown MOOCs to suffer from several challenges. Chief among these have been low participation and completion rates, which are often attributed to limitations in how opportunities for personalisation and social interaction are implemented. For the current study, a dedicated LMOOC was designed and implemented, called the "Social and Personal Online Language Course (SPOLC)." This language learning environment incorporates a recommendation system and emphasizes personalisation and social interaction. The study identified the types of learning behaviour that were related to course completion and observed how 270 learners in the LMOOC used the various course features. The data were collected using learning analytical methods and analysed using binary logistic regression and feature extraction prediction model. The results demonstrated that working in groups and creating a learning plan were important factors associated with course completion, while interacting with other learners online was not. We conclude with several suggestions and implications for future LMOOC design, implementation, and research.},

Methods: Participants in three different course delivery modes (face-to-face, online, and live interactive) were enrolled in a public speaking course with standardized adaptive reading quizzes, exams, and speech assignments. Participants completed several measures over the course of the semester and had their responses paired up with their end-of-semester grade book data. Results: Results of this study indicate that students who were enrolled in a face-to-face course and transitioned online during the COVID-19 pandemic were outperformed by online and learning interactive students in several of the standardized assignments in the course. Conclusions: Overall, face-to-face (FtF) students performed four percentage points lower in the course than the learning interactive and online groups while also demonstrating more emotional interest in the course than the other two groups. Implication for Theory and/or Practice: In future transitions to remote learning, FtF students may experience greater disruption than existing online students. Instructors should be mindful of this finding in transitioning to remote learning during the semester.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom model has gained significant attention as an innovative pedagogical approach to teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL). This method promotes active learning, student engagement, and improved language proficiency by shifting content delivery to pre-class activities and dedicating class time to interactive and collaborative tasks. This systematic review synthesizes findings from seven peer-reviewed studies published between 2016 and 2024, selected through a PRISMA-guided search of ERIC, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases. The analysis highlights the flipped classroom's effectiveness in enhancing EFL learners' speaking, listening, and reading skills, fostering autonomy, and reducing language learning anxiety. Despite its benefits, challenges remain, including technological disparities, variations in student readiness, and insufficient teacher training. The review underscores the need for tailored professional development, equitable access to digital resources, and adaptive strategies to address these obstacles. Additionally, cultural and contextual factors significantly influence the model's success, necessitating further exploration to optimize implementation in diverse educational settings. This systematic review contributes to the growing body of research on flipped classrooms, providing insights for educators and policymakers to enhance the efficacy of this approach. By addressing identified challenges and leveraging their advantages, the flipped classroom model offers a promising avenue for transforming EFL education and meeting the demands of 21st-century learners in a globalized world.},

	url = {https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED599215},
	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been shown to be a very powerful technique in recent years on a wide range of applications. Much of the prior DRL work took the "online" learning approach. However, given the challenges of building accurate simulations for modeling student learning, we investigated applying DRL to induce a pedagogical policy through an "offiine" approach. In this work, we explored the effectiveness of offiine DRL for pedagogical policy induction in an Intelligent Tutoring System. Generally speaking, when applying offiine DRL, we face two major challenges: one is limited training data and the other is the credit assignment problem caused by delayed rewards. In this work, we used Gaussian Processes to solve the credit assignment problem by estimating the inferred immediate rewards from the final delayed rewards. We then applied the DQN and Double-DQN algorithms to induce adaptive pedagogical strategies tailored to individual students. Our empirical results show that without solving the credit assignment problem, the DQN policy, although better than Double-DQN, was no better than a random policy. However, when combining DQN with the inferred rewards, our best DQN policy can outperform the random yet reasonable policy, especially for students with high pre-test scores.

	abstract = {A top education priority in the United States is to address the needs of one of the fastest growing yet lowest performing student populations--English learner students (Capps et al., 2005). English learner students come from homes where a non-English language is spoken and need additional academic support to access the mainstream curriculum. These students account for about 10 percent of the preK-12 student population in the United States (Aud et al., 2013). Spanish-speaking students account for 80 percent of the English learner student population in the United States and, because they live disproportionately in poverty and attend schools with higher percentages of racial/ethnic minority students, students from low-income households, and students with low achievement, Spanish-speaking students are at greater risk of low achievement than other English learner students (Capps et al., 2005). This study examined how teachers and school staff administered computer-adaptive assessments of literacy to English learner students in grades 3-5 and how they used the assessments to monitor students' growth in literacy skills. It presents findings that may aid districts in implementing a computer-adaptive assessment of literacy skills for English learner students as well as for other students.

	url = {https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED630884},
	abstract = {In adaptive learning systems, various models are employed to obtain the optimal learning schedule and review for a specific learner. Models of learning are used to estimate the learner's current recall probability by incorporating features or predictors proposed by psychological theory or empirically relevant to learners' performance. Logistic regression for knowledge tracing has been used widely in modern learner performance modeling. Notably, the learning history included in such models is typically confined to learners' prior accuracy performance without paying attention to learners' response time (RT), such as the performance factors analysis (PFA) model. However, RT and accuracy may give us a more comprehensive picture of a learner's learning trajectory. For example, without considering RT, we cannot estimate whether the learner's performance has reached the automatic or fluent level since these criteria are not accuracy based. Therefore, in the current research, we propose and test new RT-related features to capture learners' correct RT fluctuations around their estimated ideal fluent RT. Our results indicate that the predictiveness of the standard PFA model can be increased by up to 10\% for our test data after incorporating RT-related features, but the complexity of the question format constrains the improvement during practice. If the question is of low complexity and the observed accuracy of the learner can be influenced by guessing, which results in the imprecision measured by accuracy, then the RT-related features provide additional predictive power. In other words, RT-related features are informative when accuracy alone does not completely reflect learners' learning processes. [For the complete proceedings, see ED630829.]},

	abstract = {Background/purpose: This research aimed to evaluate the impact of integrating the WSQ-based flipped learning method with cooperative learning on speaking performance among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. Addressing the challenges EFL learners face in oral proficiency, the study sought to determine whether this innovative pedagogical approach could enhance vocabulary pronunciation, oral fluency, and content length in speaking tasks. Materials/methods: The study employed a single-group quasi-experimental design with 25 tertiary-level EFL learners aged 18 to 21. Due to participant attrition, the final sample size was 15. Over six weeks, participants underwent an intervention combining multimedia content, cooperative learning principles, and Watch-Summary-Question (WSQ) worksheets. Pre-test and post-test evaluations assessed vocabulary pronunciation accuracy, oral fluency, and speaking content length. Results: The findings demonstrated significant improvements in speaking performance. Participants' average pronunciation scores increased from 10.33 to 13.47, oral fluency scores rose from 4.27 to 7.49, and speaking content length expanded from 147 to 229 words. All improvements were statistically significant at the 0.01 significance level, underscoring the efficacy of the integrated approach in enhancing EFL learners' oral proficiency. Conclusion: The study concludes that combining WSQ-based flipped learning with cooperative learning positively influences EFL learners' word pronunciation accuracy and oral proficiency. These results align with previous research supporting the effectiveness of blended pedagogical strategies. Educators can adopt this approach to improve oral English instruction. Future research should examine its long-term effects and applicability in diverse language learning contexts.},

Over nine weeks within the "Research Methods and Presentation Skills" course, the intervention included training sessions, a speaking rubric, an attitude questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. Data analysis encompassed quantitative methods like t-tests and qualitative methods such as thematic analysis. The findings demonstrated that PA and NSRP activities significantly enhanced oral performance by fostering speaking skills, cultural competence, and self-awareness. NSRP activities improved speaking complexity, accuracy, and fluency through real-life communication scenarios, enhancing motivation via authentic interactions. PA complemented NSRP by promoting collaborative learning, self-reflection, and critical self-evaluation. Pedagogically, effective implementation of PA and NSRP aligned with communicative language teaching principles integrated digital literacy, and accommodated learner diversity.},

Students took short speaking tests before and after the class, and the fluency, complexity and accuracy of the pre- and posttests were measured to see which, if any, of these three aspects of proficiency would show improvement. The results indicated that participants made marginal progress in fluency, reducing their number of pauses and increasing their raw speech rate slightly, and significantly improved their syntactic complexity (p{\textless}0.001, d=1.1) and both syntactic (p=0.04, d=0.48) and pronunciation accuracy (p=0.002, d=0.75), but did not seem to make gains in lexical complexity. Overall, the results suggest that project-based learning can result in clear improvements in oral proficiency, meaning that it can be appropriately implemented in oral communication classes, but that the greatest gains are likely to be made in accuracy and syntactic complexity. However, it is still unclear whether different types of project settings will affect L2 oral proficiency in the same way.},

Two intact classes of EFL university students studied a compulsory subject of their department under two different types of classroom instruction. The first group of students was trained with explicit oral strategy training instruction, which taught them to learn and practice strategies to improve their speech fluency. The second group was instructed to practice the task twice as much as the first group using implicit task-based instruction. The audio recording of both groups' oral task performance in the pre-test and post-test conditions were rated for proficiency, pronunciation, discourse, vocabulary, grammar, and complexity. Two English teachers were trained to rate the recordings based on two oral proficiency rubrics. The non-parametric tests and estimation analysis results showed that both groups' oral proficiency improved significantly, with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. The comparison of both groups' results showed that the two types of instruction had a comparable effect on students' oral proficiency. The current study's findings suggest that the use of teachers' judgments can be necessary for classroom-based studies to measure the effects of instruction on gains in learners' oral proficiency.},

Also, little is known about the impact of exact task repetition on trade-off effects between linguistic performance areas among child learners. To help fill this gap, we investigated the impact of task repetition on 40 Chinese EFL learners' oral production. The children repeated the same story-telling task three times, and transcripts of their performance were coded for linguistic complexity, accuracy, and fluency. Complexity was expressed in terms of overall complexity and subordination and phrasal complexity. We assessed accuracy with weighted clause ratios and proportion of errors. Fluency was captured by repair and breakdown fluency measures. Wilcoxon signed rank tests revealed positive effects for task repetition on fluency and accuracy. Trade-off effects observed during participants' first performance had decreased by their third retelling. These results support Skehan's (1998) Limited Capacity model and suggest that task repetition is a useful pedagogical tool in instructed child L2 contexts.},

This study intended to investigate EFL students' social media as speaking strategies used vis-a-vis their speaking proficiency. A descriptive correlational design was used in this study. The participants were 70 English major students (second year and third year) at Wolkite University. To this end, data were collected using a questionnaire, the IELTS speaking proficiency test, and an interview to obtain reliable information. The findings showed that Facebook and YouTube were the most frequently used social media by learners, even though they felt less confident, more anxious, and less willing to communicate in English. The results also indicated that learners lacked awareness of how to purposefully use social media to address their speaking challenges. Conversely, the findings of this study showed that there was a positive correlation between the students' use of social media and their speaking proficiency (r=0.461, p=0.000, p{\textgreater}0.05). However, the students' speaking proficiency was very poor because learners didn't use social media for educational purposes, especially speaking skills. This might be because the learners did not use social networks effectively to promote their speaking proficiency. Therefore, it is suggested that in the learning of speaking skills, more attention should be paid to investigating the use of social media as a speaking strategy.},

First, it investigates rater reliability by comparing raters' scores using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and ANOVA. Second, applying generalizability theory (G-theory), the correlations between the scores are examined to understand the relationships between different assessment dimensions and how they contribute to a comprehensive evaluation of speaking proficiency. Third, a thematic analysis is performed on raters' comments to gain a deeper understanding of raters' rationale. The findings suggested that a higher number of raters increases the reliability of the ratings, although diminishing returns are observed above a certain threshold. Also, several key themes emerged in relation to the criteria. The study highlights the crucial role of detailed analytical rubrics and cooperation sessions between raters in improving the reliability of oral EFL assessments.},

This study examined how four experienced EFL teachers conceptualized and implemented speaking instruction within an exam-oriented educational context, focusing on their instructional approaches, responses to contextual constraints, and reconciliation of beliefs with practice. Employing a multiple-case qualitative design, data were collected through (POIs), classroom observations, and stimulated-recall interviews. Thematic analysis revealed variations in instructional approaches, with teachers navigating tensions between beliefs about oral proficiency and institutional pressures. Some participants adopted direct, structured methodologies emphasizing controlled output, while others incorporated communicative, learner-centered activities. Contextual factors, including curriculum mandates, high-stakes testing, and student proficiency levels, influenced instructional choices, though teachers demonstrated agency through localized adaptations. The study highlights the affective dimensions of speaking instruction, particularly strategies for mitigating learner anxiety and balancing error correction with motivation. Findings point to the need for assessment reforms that integrate speaking components and targeted professional development to equip teachers with effective oral skills pedagogy. This research examined the interaction between teacher cognition and contextual factors, contributing to the understanding of teacher intervention within assessment-driven educational systems in EFL contexts.},

As a result of the normality assumption test, the logistic regression analysis was applied and the model was significant in classification according to L2 proficiency and the classification was correct in 62.9\% of the studied cases. Furthermore, it showed that the best predictor of L2 speaking proficiency was the complex nominal per T-unit (CNT). Specifically, upon the acquisition of CNT, EFL learners are 6.4 times more likely to achieve higher proficiency in speaking English. Taken together, this paper suggests that EFL students' quality of writing can be effectively used to distinguish their speaking ability.},

This quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a mobile-based intervention to develop Thai EFL learners' speaking. Thirty students from a secondary school in southern Thailand were assigned to complete five oral tasks through the dynamic assessment process as an intervention on WhatsApp in order to develop their oral accuracy. Quantitative data were collected from the oral pre-test and post-test to examine the students' speaking development by utilizing the paired samples t-test. The results showed a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test after the implementation of the MALL-based intervention.

	abstract = {This study investigated the effects of a reading assistant software on the fluency and accuracy of speech production among EFL university students, employing a one-group pretest-posttest design. The participants included 50 Thai undergraduate English majors in their first and second years. Data were analyzed using paired samples t-tests to measure L2 oral fluency, specifically pruned speech rate (PSR) and mean length of run (MLR). Accuracy rate was assessed by quantifying the proportion of error-free clauses within the participants' speeches from the pretest and posttest and calculating the average number of error-free clauses per T-unit. Results indicated significant improvements in speech fluency, evidenced by longer uninterrupted speech segments, fewer disfluencies like filled pauses and repairs, and increased overall fluency. Additionally, the post-test showed a higher percentage of error-free clauses compared to the pretest, reflecting a substantial enhancement in grammatical accuracy. This suggests that the intervention had a positive impact on the participants' ability to produce grammatically accurate and error-free clauses. These outcomes suggest that the reading assistant software effectively enhances both the fluency and grammatical accuracy of speech production in EFL learners, underscoring its potential benefits in language education contexts.},

The study used a One-Group Pre-Test Post-Test Design, which involved 30 undergraduate math-major students in a Thai public university. Over eight weeks, the study group was instructed using teacher-prepared materials delivered through task-based learning and graphic organizer techniques. Pre- and post-tests were conducted to measure listening and speaking proficiency progression. In addition, the participants completed a self-evaluation form with professional competencies relating to listening and speaking before and after the study to measure the extent to which they have progressed. The results showed a significant improvement (p {\textless} 0.05) in listening and speaking proficiency, with learners advancing from beginner to independent user levels on the CEFR Global Scale. While most learners demonstrated substantial improvement, some showed moderate progress. This research emphasizes the potential of task-based learning and graphic organizer techniques as an effective method for tertiary-level undergraduate EFL student teachers. The findings offer valuable insights for designing and implementing language learning programs, emphasizing the importance of learner commitment and motivation. This study can serve as a practical guide for similar learner populations and provide implications for future language learning initiatives.},

	abstract = {The study explored the impact of multimedia-enhanced STEAM activities on English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' development of oracy skills and willingness to communicate (WTC) in an online course. The sample included 42 EFL learners who were randomly split into two groups with 21 students in each. Before the study, both groups' listening and speaking proficiency was assessed by the listening and speaking modules of the IELTS test. Also, the WTC questionnaire was utilized to evaluate their WTC in English before the study. The experimental group received multimedia-enhanced instruction where the concepts of each domain of STEAM were taught by multimedia clips along the course. Meanwhile, the content was taught to the control group by conventional teaching materials of the textbook. The instruction was online and lasted for five months. Both groups' oral proficiency and WTC were assessed again after the study. One-way Multivariate Analysis of Variance method was used to analyze the collected data. The outcomes displayed a significant difference between the oral skills of the two groups and a non significant difference between their WTC after the treatment in favor of the experimental group. The practical significance of the results can be found in the tremendous potential of integrating STEAM curriculum with language teaching, particularly in technology-enhanced learning environments, for promoting students' interest in STEAM professions in countries like Iran that have a crisis in educating STEAM specialists. Follow-up studies on combining STEAM topics with teaching other subject matters using emerging technologies across different levels of education are recommended.},

The participants who underwent this study were 28 male Saudi students studying in secondary school, namely at Sharia Institute. They were divided into control and experimental groups. Data was collected via post-test to conduct a valid comparison between the two groups. The 14 students in the experimental group had been using Duolingo for a period of four consecutive months while the participants in the control group have never used Duolingo. To make a valid comparison of the mean score between the two groups, an independent samples t-test was used in this experiment. After analysing the results, it has been concluded that the integration of Duolingo in the learning process has a fundamental positive impact on enhancing participants' speaking proficiency as well as improving their overall language skills. Additionally, the participants' positive attitude towards Duolingo was an intrinsic factor that helped alleviate their anxiety when speaking.},

	abstract = {The primary aim of this study was to address the challenges of low speaking proficiency and motivation among second-year students in an Islamic education university department. This was achieved by implementing an integrated teaching strategy within a Classroom Action Research (CAR) framework to enhance students' speaking skills and active involvement in the learning process. The study employed a CAR design, conducted over two cycles. Each cycle comprised four stages: planning, action, observation, and reflection. The intervention involved an integrated teaching strategy that combined multiple language skills--listening, speaking, reading, and writing--within a cohesive instructional framework. Data were collected through post-tests, observation checklists, and reflection notes. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and paired sample t-tests, while qualitative data were examined through thematic analysis. The results demonstrated significant improvements in both speaking performance and student engagement between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. In Cycle 1, the majority of students scored in the "Fair" category, with only 24.39\% achieving "Good" scores. Following strategic adjustments, Cycle 2 saw a marked increase in average post-test scores, with 87.80\% of students meeting or exceeding the success criteria. The level of active involvement also rose significantly, reflecting the effectiveness of the revised integrated strategy. The findings highlight the value of integrated language instruction and the importance of iterative refinement in teaching methodologies. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of language acquisition and offers practical insights for EFL educators, particularly in contexts where students face challenges in developing speaking proficiency. The study underscores the need for creating supportive and engaging learning environments that foster student participation and language development. This study provides empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of integrated teaching strategies in EFL contexts, particularly within Islamic education settings. It demonstrates how Classroom Action Research can be utilized to improve teaching practices and student outcomes continuously. The research offers a model that can be adapted and applied in similar educational contexts to enhance language learning.},

This research paper examined the difficulties of oral presentation EFL learners encountered, strategies used to make oral presentation well and the perceived role of lecturer in improving EFL learners' oral presentation skills. With regard to achieving these objectives, questionnaires distributed to 150 EFL learners, and face-to-face interviews were conducted. The quantitative data were analyzed through SPSS by conducting frequencies and percentages, independent sample t-test and ANOVA tests. The results of the study revealed that learners had a problem with oral fluency, accuracy and pronunciation during oral presentation, feel frightened when a lot of people are watching them, afraid of being assessed by their classmates in front of the class, having low self-confidence. Furthermore, considering a crucial role of lecturer in improving oral presentation skills, this study also discovered that lecturer has to show learners videos of good speakers for enhancing their presentation skills and lecturer has to give learners freedom to choose their own topics that lower their anxiety. It is hoped that the ideas discussed will provide the learners and lecturers with basic guidelines of how to improve the learners' oral presentation and assist learners to work their way out of anxiety.},

Additionally, descriptive statistical analysis was conducted on the questionnaire results, complemented by thematic analysis of students' reflective journals. T he findings revealed a strong positive correlation between EFL students' SRL strategy usage and their speaking course outcomes. Reflective journal analysis indicated that students tailored SRL strategies to their learning processes within MOOC contexts. The study provides practical insights for incorporating SRL training into MOOC-based learning and offers a theoretical foundation for promoting SRL across diverse educational systems.},

This study involved the observation of non-English major students in the foreign language department of Nanjing Tech University. Its aim was to assess critically the factors that affect the speaking performances of Chinese EFL Learners, find out their motivational levels and explore ways to improve EFL proficiency. Two survey questionnaires, as well as an interview item, were constructed. Seventy-five respondents were conveniently sampled for the Chinese EFL learner's speaking difficulty questionnaire and, the English motivational scale, and ten out of the Seventy-five were randomly selected to respond to the interview. The factors that inhibit speaking performances were categorized as either linguistic or psychological. The outcome of the study revealed that Chinese EFL learners have speaking problems that relate more to psychological factors like anxiety, fear of mistakes, unwillingness, and fear of negative evaluation than linguistic factors such as lack of vocabulary, pronunciation, insufficient knowledge of grammar rules, reading and oral presentation. Furthermore, the researchers investigated the motivational levels of respondents toward speaking English as motivation is considered a fundamental element in achieving oral proficiency. The findings showed that Chinese EFL learner's instrumental motivations are slightly dominant than their integrative motivation. The study recommends that instructors or teachers should create a conducive environment that will help reduce anxiety or shyness and gather adequate strategies like regular oral presentations or classroom debates to boost EFL learners' speaking confidence.},

It was argued that concept mapping helps them take a more active role to effectively organize the concepts, plan their tasks, and monitor their activities. Besides, repetition techniques may lead to linguistic proceduralization and automaticity which results in positive changes in underlying cognitive mechanisms and ultimately contributes to long-term and transferrable effects on speaking fluency.

Six 11th graders in a rural at-risk context in a vocational public high school in Hualqui, Chile participated in this study. The Elevator Pitch technique was implemented during seven sessions. Data were collected by conducting a pre- and post-intervention test and a focus group. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test; thematic analysis was used to categorize the responses from the qualitative data. Results suggest an improvement in oral fluency and a positive perception toward the technique used during the intervention, which illustrates how effective the Elevator Pitch technique could be among Chilean learners from similar contexts.},

The study employed an experimental design featuring a mixed-methods approach to data collection that involved pre- and post-testing of the participants' speaking proficiency as well as semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The study sample consisted of 28 EFL university students who were divided into the control and experimental groups. The participants in the experimental group used Cambly to conduct audio calls with native speakers of English over a period of 4 weeks. The quantitative analysis of the participants' speaking proficiency tests revealed no significant differences between the experimental and control groups' post-test scores. Moreover, no significant differences were found between the experimental group's pre- and post-test scores. The qualitative analysis of the participants' interviews revealed that the use of Cambly had a positive influence on their speaking proficiency, motivation, anxiety level, speaking opportunities, autonomy, social relationships, and cultural awareness.},

	abstract = {Assessing speaking skills is regarded as a complex and hard process compared with the other language skills. Considering the idiosyncratic characteristics of EFL learners, oral proficiency assessment issue becomes even more important. Keeping this situation in mind, judgements and reliability of raters need to be consistent with each other. This study aims to compare native and non-native English language teachers' evaluation of EFL learners' speaking skills. Based on the oral proficiency scores in the final exam conducted at a state university in Turkey, the study analysed the scores given by native and non-native English language teachers to 80 EFL students attending preparatory classes in the 2014-2015 academic year. 3 native and 3 non-native English language teachers participated in the study. Data were collected through an analytic rating scale and analysed with the help of "independent samples t-test" and "Pearson product-moment correlation test." Pearson product-moment correlation test (calculated as 0,763) indicated that the raters had high inter-rater reliability coefficients. T-test results revealed that there is no statistically significant difference in the total scores given by both groups of teachers. The study also investigated the different components of speaking skills such as fluency, pronunciation, accuracy, vocabulary, and communication strategies with regard to the existence of significant difference between the scores. The only component which created a statistically significant difference was found to be pronunciation, which was expected prior to the research. In line with the overall findings of the study, it can be concluded that native and non-native English language teachers display almost identical rating behaviour in assessing EFL students' oral proficiency.},

	abstract = {A large number of research studies have highlighted the relevance of oral narratives for describing children's linguistic constraints, developmental stages of narrative discourse patterns, and sociocultural identities. Yet, little research has been found on the use of oral narratives as a means to longitudinally improve oral discourse coherence and fluency in English as a Foreign Language (EFL). This article reports a case study which was aimed at exploring and describing oral language enhancement in 26 Chilean preservice teachers of English through the implementation of oral narrative tasks over four months. Oral narrative samples were collected through audio recordings, then transcribed and analyzed through the Narrative Assessment Profile, and analytic rubrics elaborated in light of the literature review carried out for oral fluency. Findings suggest a relation between oral narrative tasks and oral discourse coherence and fluency improvement, with a large effect size (25\% for social sciences) on oral discourse coherence. Also, a new measure and dysfluency indicator of L2 oral fluency was discovered and defined as false reformulation. It could be concluded that oral narrative tasks might constitute a valuable instrument for enhancing oral English as a foreign language over time.},

The research investigates how AR-supported lessons influence learners' fluency, pronunciation, confidence, and engagement while identifying cognitive load and digital readiness challenges. Materials/methods: A mixed-methods, sequential explanatory design was employed, comprising a quasi-experimental one-group pre-test and post-test procedure alongside student surveys and focus group interviews. Eighty undergraduate students participated in AR-enhanced speaking tasks over two academic semesters. The study utilized the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) as theoretical frameworks to guide the development of instruments and interpretation of findings. Results: Quantitative findings revealed significant improvements in students' speaking performance, particularly in fluency and pronunciation. Survey data indicated increased student engagement and reduced speaking anxiety. Qualitative data from focus groups provided further insight into learners' experiences, highlighting increased speaking confidence, challenges with AR usability, and the importance of instructional scaffolding. Conclusion: The results suggest that AR can be a powerful pedagogical tool for promoting communicative competence in ESP-speaking contexts. However, its effective implementation requires attention to cognitive load management, digital literacy, and the integration of structured support mechanisms. These findings offer practical implications for enhancing speaking instruction in technology-rich educational environments.},

Paired-samples t-tests results revealed that, as hypothesized, participants who played Spaceteam ESL improved their ORF on measures of speed on all tasks, possibly because of the fast-paced nature of the game. However, no significant differences were observed in terms of accuracy due to a ceiling effect: the participants had already mastered the intricacies of the letter-to-sound rules of English orthography. Overall, these findings corroborate our hypothesis that some of the affordances of Spaceteam ESL (e.g., focus on speed reading, multiple and varied opportunities for practice) could contribute to the development of some aspects of oral reading fluency.},

This study investigated the potential of project-based learning to address this problem by promoting more interactive, student-centered learning experiences that foster authentic language use, specifically aiming to improve public speaking performance among university students in China, who are learning English as a foreign language (EFL). An explanatory sequential mixed method study, involving the pretest and post-test for quantitative data and semistructured interviews for qualitative data, was conducted with 60 students purposely selected as the research participants. By the triangulation of the quantitative and qualitative findings, it was found that students in the experimental group who underwent the project-based learning intervention showed a significant improvement in English public speaking performance compared with the control group. In addition, students who participated in the interview held a positive attitude toward integrating project-based learning strategy into the process of learning English public speaking. These results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the adoption of project-based learning approach in EFL teaching, particularly in contexts where enhancing oral communication skills is a priority.},

After the researcher ensured the homogeneity of the participants, a researcher-made multiple-choice pre-test on present and past English tenses was administered. Later, the first and second experimental groups were treated with +Polite Explicit Feedback (in the form of elicitations) and +Polite Implicit CF (in the form of recasts), respectively while the control groups were provided with -Polite Feedback of the same forms. Following the assessment of the learners' oral grammatical accuracy immediately after the treatment (uptake), a multiple-choice post-test was administered two weeks after the immediate post-test to assess their delayed recall. The independent samples t-test and ANCOVA conducted on the pre-test, immediate learning scores, and delayed post-test scores indicated that, although polite CF in both groups had a significant effect on learners' grammatical accuracy, +Polite Explicit Feedback had a more significant effect on participants' performance than -Polite Explicit Feedback and +Polite Implicit Feedback. The results underscore the significance of integrating politeness element into CF discourse, bearing implications for educational planners, materials developers, and EFL instructors.},

The data were obtained by means of two tests (pre and post) and examined using a speaking fluency rubric. The calculation of rubric variables was done using the software Praat and Jwatcher and analyzed using the SPSS. After the implementation of the two techniques, fluency increased in both groups. However, the experimental group showed a significant difference compared to the control group. The use of the 4/3/2 evidenced the importance of planning, practicing, and repeating; and the self-assessment revealed the importance of feedback. Both techniques indicated to students that they could be autonomous in their learning, and they can search for different ways to reach their goals, making them the primary agent of their learning. The implications for teaching/learning and the limitations found during the study are discussed. Some recommendations for future research are presented.

Students acquired the ability to selfstudy, but this was insufficient for oral practice because distance learning limited direct interactions. Perceived current proficiency increased, but imaginary proficiency and English importance did not. Their ease in using English in their daily life improved, and they felt the gap between the current and imaginary proficiencies decreased. The ideal L2 self increased, based on instrumentality and integrativeness. This finding indicates that students understood that they were undergoing the process of becoming fluent English speakers.

	abstract = {Speaking is a crucial form of communication in language learning settings. Through speaking skill, ESL/EFL language learners can communicate and convey information. Pictorial aids have been deployed as efficacious mediatory tools in teaching various disciplines such as language teaching. Still, to the best of the researchers' knowledge, a direct look at the impacts of pictorial aids on EFL intermediate learners' speaking proficiency has been less addressed. Thus, the main concern of the present study was to investigate the role of pictorial aids in creating a favorable ground for teaching speaking and how it may affect learners' speaking proficiency. To this end, 40 intermediate EFL learners were selected out of 70 from a private English language institute in Shiraz, Iran. The homogeneity of their proficiency level was established via the administration of Oxford Proficiency Test. Then they were randomly divided into two control and experimental groups. Three instruments were used to answer the research questions: Pre-test and post-test interviews, classroom observation, and a questionnaire. Subsequently, the participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 20) and a control (n = 20) group. During 6 sessions, the experimental group received treatment while using pictorial aids. By contrast, the control group followed their routine instruction at the institution through traditional method, i.e. the tasks of Top notch 2. Then by the end of the study, an interview was held as a post test in order to monitor any effect the treatment might have on increasing speaking proficiency of the participants under the investigation. The results gained from a post-test were analyzed via t-test indicated that visual aids had a positive impact on the intermediate learners' speaking proficiency in which experimental group outperformed control group.},

	abstract = {In light of the impact of professional and personal skills of teachers on their students, the purpose of this paper was to delimit the efficiency of corpus on pre-service teachers' self-directed learning and oral proficiency. It was anticipated that pre-service teachers receiving training on corpus would reveal greater gains in self-directed learning and oral skills. Questions formulated to achieve the purpose of the study focused on: (1) Finding out differences in self-directed learning scale scores regarding experimental and control group. (2) Determining oral skills suitable for the EEL pre-service teachers. (3) Finding out differences in oral skills test regarding experimental and control group. Four instruments -designed by the researcher- that include: (oral skills checklist, self-directed learning scale, oral skills test and scoring rubric for oral skills) were used for collecting data. Findings indicated that the regular procedure used for teaching oral proficiency is not as significant like the corpus approach that developed self-directed learning and oral proficiency. Pre-service teachers of experimental group outclassed their equivalents of the control group in self-directed learning as well as oral proficiency.},

The study also tried to compare the results from online synchronous DA sessions, which were done in the form of one-to-one online training over Google Meet, with the results from asynchronous DA sessions, in which the trainer and the trainees were interacting over Gmail. To this end, 90 EFL institutional students from Iran, who were getting ready to take the IELTS test, were selected as the participants of the program. The cases were then divided into two experimental groups and one control group, each with 30 contributors. IELTS speaking tasks, marked by IELTS speaking band descriptors, were used to assess their speaking skills. Comparing the pre-test and post-test, the findings indicated development in all four areas of fluency, vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Moreover, comparing the results from the two experimental groups showed that the participants who received asynchronous DA sessions outperformed the other experimental group. It is worth mentioning that a broader level of development was observed in experimental groups than the control group, in which the members received synchronous non-Dynamic Assessment (non-DA) methods.},

To carry out this study, 300 elementary level EFL learners were chosen. A Key English Test (KET) was administered to ensure homogeneity on the learners. They were divided into two groups of experimental and control. A WTC questionnaire developed by Macintyre, Baker, Clement, and Conrod (2001) was used, after validation through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Modeling, as an instrument to obtain primary data. The results of Mann-Whitney U test revealed that simulated environment had positive effects on the participants' WTC. The findings of this study suggest that understanding how a simulated environment affects EFL learners' success in speaking proficiency can help institutes to provide such environments for EFL learners and instructors. This method can be presented at different levels of English proficiency. The focus of this study was mainly on speaking skill; therefore, similar studies can be conducted regarding other language skills, e.g., writing, listening and reading.},

The study utilized mixed-design analysis strategies as quantitative tests (pre- and post-vocabulary test, speaking evaluation rubric, cognitive load scale) with 33 Turkish EFL learners studying at tertiary level who participated in an online English course and interviews with 21 volunteers. Quantitative findings revealed increased vocabulary achievement after DS use and improved English-speaking skills in terms of spoken grammar, vocabulary use, fluency and coherence, and pronunciation after repeated DS use in three stories, despite high level of cognitive load due to technical incompetency of the participants. In addition, the results obtained from the qualitative data match with the results of the quantitative data in terms of positive evaluations on the impact of DS for vocabulary use, error correction, sentence formation, pronunciation, and self-study. DS can also be effectively used in online EFL education by eliminating the drawbacks of students' digital incompetency at tertiary level. The results of this study are expected to shed light on the practitioners aiming to use DS in online language learning for teaching speaking and improving vocabulary achievement.},

Formulaic language is considered an effective way to foster speaking fluency because prefabricated chunks are faster to retrieve than constructing sentences word by word (Wray, 2002). In spite of the benefits of learning formulaic language in L2 learning theory, few empirical studies were found which examined the effects of formulaic language instruction in intact classrooms, in particular in the EFL (English as a Foreign Language) context. By introducing some effective classroom tasks to foster L2 learners' speaking fluency focusing on formulaic language in this article, the author emphasizes the need for empirical research involving EFL learners.},

It also investigates the learners' perceptions of the use of digital video recordings in a speaking class. 10 Turkish EFL learners participated in this study. To determine the impact of digital video recording on EFL learners' oral performance, the speaking module of IELTS was modified as pre- and post-test. In addition to the analysis of the scores assigned to the learners by two raters using an analytic scale, an analysis of learners' discourse in pre- and post-test was undertaken to determine whether measures of fluency in learners' output differ as a result of the video recording. The results suggest that the incorporation of digital video recordings into speaking classes improved the learners' overall speaking proficiency; however, it did not lead to a significant improvement in learners' oral fluency. Yet, the analysis of the qualitative data showed that the utilization of digital video recordings may not only bolster the learners' self-confidence, but also encourage them to take risks with the target language.},

The research was meant to investigate the effect of DA in improving teaching and learning speaking in Indonesia especially English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in university. The research was conducted using a qualitative method by involving four Indonesian university learners in the first semester. The participants received the same treatments through pre-test and self-reflection, feedback and knowledge expansion, post-test and self-reflection, post-feedback, and semi-structured interviews. The instruments were used to analyze the learners' non-fluency and mastery problem. The analysis showed that the learners' speaking performance was improved after experiencing DA sessions. The results of the test and self-reflection showed significant improvement in their speaking. The finding showed some positive effects of DA on EFL learners' speaking performance. In interviews, learners showed positive experiences and attitude toward DA since it served them a comfortable, structured, practical, and meaningful platform to recognize their speaking behavior, weaknesses, strength, and needs. Furthermore, it also helped them to get the objective feedbacks with less anxiety. The researchers conclude that DA can be applied as a primary alternative assessment in English speaking practices.},

Online lessons comprised tasks that were structured cluster of ideas to enable students to construct their own knowledge for oral production. Three broad thematic tasks, with four tasks at varying levels of complexity for each theme were carried out as treatment tasks. Upon completion of tasks under each theme, students carried out oral test tasks that were audio recorded for analysis. As a result of performing tasks of varying levels of complexity within a web-based multimedia platform setting, students' accuracy, fluency and complexity of oral EFL production improved significantly. Favourable outcomes suggest that EFL instructors could consider the MMTBLT approach and design web-based syllabus to complement language teaching.},

This study aimed to shed light on the speaking strategies that learners use to deal with problems they encounter when using the target language or to improve the quality of their L2 performance. This study deployed the Oral Communication Strategy Inventory (OCSI) developed by Nakatani (2006) to measure the strategies that students use in oral communications. In doing so, adopting the mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, this study investigated the use of speaking strategies of low and high proficiency English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in performing speaking tasks. The participants of the study were 23 low and 25 high proficiency students learning English in an institute in Iran. After performing the speaking tasks, the participants filled out the OCSI questionnaire and answered two open-ended questions. The results indicated that low and high proficiency students employ different strategies. While advanced learners used "accuracy-oriented" strategies the most and "message abandonment" strategies the least, "message reduction" strategies and "thinking in English" strategies, respectively, were found to be the most and the least frequently used by elementary learners. The Mann-Whitney U test indicated that of the six speaking strategies, only "message abandonment" and "thinking in English" strategies were found to be significantly different between elementary and advanced English learners. This study contributes in some ways to the understanding of how students' proficiency level relates to their strategy use and provides English teachers with a variety of pedagogical methods to motivate students and enhance their oral production via speaking strategies.},

For so doing, 32 Iranian EFL students were selected and randomly assigned to two conversation classes namely, control and experimental groups. Before the treatment both groups had a speaking pre-test. During 32 sessions of instruction, both classes were taught EFL conversation based on Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) approach. However, in the experimental group, in order to help learners notice the input more, the students were asked to record their authentic conversations, presentations, and dialogues in the class. Then, they were asked to transcribe their voices and identify their grammatical, phonological and lexico-semantic errors based on Keshavarz's (1999) Model of Error Analysis. Their teacher also checked their voice files and transcriptions in order to help them identify their errors. After the treatment both groups had a speaking post-test. Then, the number of speaking errors the two groups had in the pre-test and post-test were compared using ANCOVA. The results indicated that the EFL learners in the experimental group had a significantly lower number of speaking errors in the post-test compared with that of the control group which confirmed the positive effect of noticing on EFL students' speaking accuracy.},

	abstract = {Speaking a language involves more than simply knowing the linguistic components of the message, and developing language skills requires more than grammatical comprehension and vocabulary memorization. In teaching-learning processes, drama method may have some positive effects on ELL students' speaking fluency and accuracy. This study attempts to probe one of the main concerns of language learners, that is, how to improve their speaking components, e.g. oral fluency and accuracy. To attain this aim, the researchers investigated the effect of two selected texts from modern English dramas on students' speaking fluency and accuracy. They distinguished fluent from non-fluent and accurate from no accurate learners. Therefore, the current study was designed as a true experimental research and the data were gathered from 60 EFL students, whose ages are between 19-25 (80 percent girls and 20 percent boys), of English language and literature at Hormozgan University in Iran. The data were the recorded speaking transcripts which were analyzed to show the probable progresses after four-time (10 weeks) treatment. The factors to be considered in present study were the numbers of filled and unfilled pauses in each narration, the total number of words per minute, mean length of utterance, and number of stressed words. The results were compared and their temporal and linguistic measures were correlated with their fluency scores. They revealed that the speech rate, the mean length of utterance, phonation time ratio and the number of stressed words produced per minute were the best predictors of fluency scores, and thus, students' speaking fluency increased, whereas the students' speaking accuracy decreased in some areas of speaking abilities and oral communications.},

	abstract = {EFL learners' oral proficiency plays an important role in the representation of their productive skills. Especially, English language learners' speaking skills are considered as main reflection of their proficiency in foreign languages. Speaking in L2 is accepted as a vital competence for language teachers as well, who are going to teach the target language in the future. The related literature puts an emphasis on the assessment of speaking skills utilizing various techniques. However, the number of research studies, examining how dynamic assessment (DA), especially the interventionist model of dynamic assessment, can be utilized as a technique in the assessment of L2 speaking performance, is relatively limited. Thus, the main aims of the current research study are both to investigate the efficacy of the interventionist model of DA in the assessment of student teachers' speaking skills performance and to figure out their attitudes towards dynamic assessment. The participants of the current research were 29 student teachers, enrolled in the English Language Teaching Department of a state university in Turkey. To collect the quantitative data questionnaire survey was adopted and utilized as a checklist due to the number of the participants. On the other hand, to collect the qualitative data, a written structured interview was administered to the participants. The data were analyzed with the SPSS package and through the content analysis method. The findings of the current research revealed that participants were satisfied with the interventionist model and developed positive attitudes towards this assessment type. The participants stated that the interventionist dynamic assessment provided an authentic, creative and relaxing atmosphere, which decreased the level of their speaking anxiety. It can be asserted that DA can be administered to test foreign language speaking performance in language classrooms. Additionally, it was concluded that the interventionist model sustained and boosted the student teachers' oral skills achievement.},

To achieve the purpose of the study and answer the research questions, a quasi-experimental study was conducted. The participants of the study were a group of five EFL learners who were called self-assessment. The self-assessment technique was incorporated to this group. There were a pretest and posttest sessions and four sessions of treatment between the pretest and posttest. The instruments used in this study were storyboards and checklists. The data was collected via a recording device and then it was transcribed for further analysis. Paired sample T-test was used to analyze the quantitative data and for the qualitative analysis, the data on the checklist and students' self-assessment reports were used. The data on the checklist also helped to find the extent to which learners have improved in fluency in their own ideas through self-assessment. The findings of the present study showed self-assessment was helpful in improving Error free clause (p = 0.031) meaning self-assessment group made significant improvement in this feature. Considering the three other features, the comparison of pre- and posttest scores also showed a significant difference which approved effectiveness of the related treatment. The qualitative analysis of the students' self-assessment report also revealed that students found it as a helpful technique to monitor themselves and reflect on their own work.},

At the end of the intervention, silent reading rates while maintaining a [greater than or equal to] 75 \% comprehension threshold improved by 46 standard words per minute. Further, the learners who did more extensive reading (a) achieved greater reading rate gains and (b) significantly improved listening and reading scores in the TOEIC® test.

Although Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) is the most commonly used path nowadays, it has only resulted in minimal development of university learners' oral skills; i.e., English-beginner-level students usually attain minimal scores on oral performance after instruction using CLT approaches in some Higher Education Institutions. Thus, this study aims to illustrate the impact of "Grammaring approach," in combination with the practice of Form and Meaning as a complement to Use in CLT, on students' oral proficiency. Data from 38 students in control (n=19) and experimental (n=19) groups were analyzed. A descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of rubric bands from pre and post tests showed subtle improvements in aspects of Form (syntax) and Meaning (lexical use) but not in use. These results have implications on what to teach and how to teach some language skills to lower-level learners, and highlights considerations for elaborating rubrics and assessing foreign language learners.},

Since tasks and activities were found by Dewaele and MacIntyre (2014) to be most relevant to FLE, and since task complexity might interact with learners' perceptions of task difficulty, it is important to investigate how task complexity impacts FLE changes. Informed by the complex dynamic systems theory, this study employed a mixed-methods multiple case study design to study patterns and causes of high and low FLE arousals. The participants were four pairs of Taiwanese high-intermediate EFL university students who were engaged in simple or complex storytelling tasks with speech acts of refusals. The speakers' interactions were triangulated with an individual learner's rating of FLE on a per-second scale and stimulated recalls. Results revealed idiosyncratic patterns of FLE fluctuations of peer interlocutors and a high degree of overlap in sources of low and high FLE in both groups. Speakers reported high FLE as a result of interesting storylines inherent in task design and created by peers, the use of picture prompts, peer collaboration, and task performance. Performance problems, failure to retrieve appropriate vocabulary, task design, and lack of ideas led to low FLE arousals. The findings suggest that task complexity combined with other task-induced, social, and individual factors to affect the fluctuations of FLE. Implications for task design and oral communication instruction to promote FLE are discussed.},

The research focuses on transparent and non-transparent words containing the grapheme {\textless}s{\textgreater} and the phonemes /s/ and /z/ and was conducted in a Chilean rural vocational high school over four weeks, using a quasi-experimental one-group repeated-measures design with convenience sampling. Four students participated in four 90-minute sessions with two different conditions: two sessions for the implicit instruction condition and two sessions for the explicit instruction condition, each followed by a segmental pronunciation accuracy post-test. The results showed that students consistently performed well with transparent words, benefiting from clear grapheme-phoneme correspondences aligned with their L1 orthography in both conditions. In contrast, non-transparent words posed greater challenges across conditions, indicating that the type of instruction does not play a role when it comes to grapheme-phoneme incongruencies. These findings imply that transparent words serve as effective foundational tools for pronunciation, while non-transparent words require tailored teaching approaches to address grapheme-phoneme incongruencies. The limitations and recommendations for pronunciation instruction of transparent and non-transparent words are also discussed in this article.},

Presentation as planned, and paired speaking test as unplanned one were used as instruments to figure out the effects of two different test types on the test scores. Being prepared for their performances, the students did their presentations lasting between 5 and 8 minutes in front of two raters. The same participants, at the end of each level, were invited to the paired-speaking tests designed for the students to show their spontaneous performances. The performances in both tests were scored through a scale with five criteria, and the criteria along with overall scores were examined through Paired Samples t-test to reveal the effects of test type, and through bivariate regression to see the proportion of pronunciation aspect on overall scores. The results showed that in beginner level, although no differences were found in the overall scores, the test type induced differences in pronunciation, vocabulary and relevance aspect of their speaking performances. Similar results were found in elementary level besides the difference found in accuracy aspect, which resulted in a significant difference in overall scores. However, in pre-intermediate level, the only significant difference was found in pronunciation. On the other hand, in intermediate level all the aspects along with the overall scores were found to be affected by the test type except for fluency and pronunciation. The bivariate regression revealed that the effect of pronunciation sub-score on overall scores is significant in each level and test type.},

The quantitative part was based on a descriptive statistic study. It was collected through the students' speaking pre and post-test. The results were processed and analyzed through SPSS version 25. To compare the mean scores of the students in the pre and post- test, a T test for one sample was used. In addition, the qualitative part based on phenomenological research was gathered through direct classroom observations and group discussion. Findings indicated that: firstly, the study participants reached their A1 oral performance level in the evaluation criteria of comprehension, interaction, fluency, pronunciation. Secondly, students had positive attitudes toward CL strategies. Thirdly, through CL strategies students became more motivated and less reluctant during oral participation. In light of the findings, CL should be adopted in primary English learning as it helps improve learners' EFL peaking skill.},

	abstract = {EFL learners often have problems to speak properly in English. As the purpose of teaching speaking is to improve the learners' oral production, language teaching should maximize language use in the classrooms (Haozhang, 1997), which is achieved through implementing proper teaching techniques to require learners to learn and practice the language in EFL classes actively. Jeltova et al. (2007) know dynamic assessment (DA) as a process-oriented type of assessment which necessitates teachers and learners to interact while learners are provided with mediations based on their ZPDs. This makes DA potentially ideal for evaluating and scaffolding learners to expand their oral skills which are interactive (Son \& Kim, 2017). The present study exploiting a quantitative approach, studied the effects of the Interactionist DA on developing learners' oral production while they interacted to perform language tasks. An experimental and a control group were selected, taught, and tape-recorded based on the techniques of the interactionist DA and the traditional methods, respectively. After transcribing and analyzing the data, the findings revealed significant development in the oral production and performance of the experimental group.},

The intervention focused on what is typically considered the most challenging topic of the semester: the simple past and its functions included in the official syllabus. On the one hand, the 'flipped' part of the lessons was divided into before and after-class online activities following a set of principles for the Flipped Classroom, Communicative Language Teaching, and Multimedia Instruction. On the other hand, in-class activities focused on reviewing content and communicative oral practice. The Flipped Classroom was favorably regarded.

However, the issue of teaching English speaking in "Kampung Inggris"/English Village remains under-researched, notably viewed from the tutors' challenges and solutions in the Indonesian English as a foreign language (EFL) milieu. This study addressed this gap. Two English tutors from "Kampung Inggris"/English Village got involved as the participants. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed with thematic analysis. The findings reported that there were five challenges encountered by tutors when teaching English speaking, namely tutors' inability of exploring English language teaching materials, tutors' insufficient English vocabulary, tutors' ineffective time management during language teaching practices, demotivated tutees to learn English, and perceived teaching anxiety. In addition, the tutors stipulated four solutions to cope with such challenges, namely building a good rapport between tutor and tutees, tutors' self-motivation to English vocabulary enrichment, selecting appropriate and providing updated English language teaching materials, and motivating English language tutees. Therefore, teaching English speaking should not only rely on immersing students in fluency-based activities but also manage tutees' psychological factors to attain more effective teaching English speaking objectives.},

The current study is primarily focused on exploring the impacts of pressured vs. unpressured on-line task planning conditions on EFL students' oral production in classroom and testing contexts. The participants of the study comprised a total of 14 Iranian intermediate adult female EFL students from a private language institute in Tehran. Two parallel task cards- part 2 of IELTS Speaking Test- were given to students with and without any time pressure for task completion in the two different contexts in fulfilment of the requirement for promotion for the next instructional period. All performances were measured through fluency and coherence (FC), lexical resource (LR), and grammatical range and accuracy (GRA) indices. To compare the impacts of pressured and unpressured on-line task planning in the classroom and testing contexts, paired samples t-tests were conducted in SPSS. It was found that the removal of time pressure on students' task performance significantly impacted on their GRA in the classroom context. Regarding the testing context, it was found that, as with the classroom context, pressured on-line task planning led to higher FC compared to other indices. Also, it was found that unpressured on-line task planning had a statistically significant impact on students' GRA. Moreover, the authors observed that a trade-off effect exists between students' GRA and FC and their LR in the testing context; in other words, the more the students were stressed out to accomplish the test task and to produce correct sentences to get higher scores, the less they took risks to try extensive vocabulary and the lower their LR became.},

	abstract = {Despite many studies on assessment literacy, scant attention has been devoted to classroom assessment literacy for speaking. To bridge this gap, the present study set out to explore novice and experienced English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers' classroom assessment literacy for speaking. Twenty-six novice and experienced EFL teachers first completed three scenarios to collect data about their practices for speaking assessment. Afterwards, they went through semi-structured interview to elicit their speaking assessment knowledge. Both scenarios and interviews were framed using Xu and Brown's (2016) six-component framework of teacher assessment literacy. The focus of this study was on the teacher knowledge base, which is the second component in this framework and consists of knowledge of assessment purposes, content/criteria, and methods. Novice and experienced EFL teachers' scenario data were content analyzed through a summative approach, which led to the discovery of formative assessment and diagnostic assessment as their knowledge of assessment purposes in practice. Moreover, this analysis shed light on the teachers' six assessment criteria in practice, including accuracy, fluency, vocabulary, pronunciation, communication, and content. As to the teachers' assessment methods in practice, the findings revealed their use of role play, monolog, picture story, and questions and answers. The interview data were transcribed and content analyzed through a summative approach as well, which resulted in three main categories of assessment purposes: formative assessment, diagnostic assessment, and summative assessment. Besides knowledge of assessment purposes, the interview data substantiated the scenario findings about the teachers' assessment criteria and their beliefs about various assessment methods such as role plays, monologs, and authentic tasks. Although divergence between novice and experienced teachers' beliefs was moderate, the data demonstrated more consistency in the experienced teachers' assessment literacy for speaking. The findings imply that EFL teachers need awareness of their underlying knowledge about speaking, which is the product of their past education and language teaching experiences.},

Research attempting to understand and address continued underperformance has focused on literacy learning and teaching in schools where the language of learning and teaching (LOLT) is the same as the learners' home language. What has yet to be addressed is that a significant dilemma still exists for the many English Second Language (ESL) learners who attend schools where the LOLT is English. Aim: To establish to what extent involvement in the Whistle Stop School (WSS) early grade reading programme impacts on reading rate and comprehension performance for ESL learners learning to read in English. Setting: This research examines the WSS programme in partnership with a local quintile three school. Methods: Longitudinal, quantitative secondary data was used from oral reading fluency and comprehension assessments conducted annually over the first six years of the programme. Results: Results showed that involvement in the WSS programme had a significant impact on learner performance, with those learners involved in the programme notably outperforming those not in the programme and existing national benchmarks. Conclusion: Small-scale though the WSS is, the results demonstrate that with the right approach, the national goal to see every 10-year-old learner reading for meaning may be achievable. Contribution: This research aims to contribute to national conversations around early grade reading in South Africa by addressing the paucity of early grade reading learning research, specifically for ESL learners where LOLT is English.},

In the next phase of the study, a second IELTS speaking test was administered as the homogeneity test and the pre-test to seventy five (N = 75) learners chosen from the population and forty-eight (N = 48) homogeneous intermediate learners were selected for the study (i.e., 24 learners in control group and 24 in experimental one). The results of an independent-sample t-test gained from the study proved that not only does implementation of problem-based learning through cognition-based tasks significantly increased intermediate participants' speaking proficiency, but also it had more positive effect in comparison to objective-based tasks on participants' speaking proficiency. Therefore, it is suggested that problem-based learning ought to be taken into account by educational scholars, those in charge of syllabus, material producers, language teachers and language learners.},

To these ends, a quantitative dominant mixed methods triangulation design was put to use. Yaman and Kavasoglu's (2013) Turkish adaptation of Oral Communication Strategy Inventory was the main data collection instrument, accompanied by follow-up interviews to corroborate the quantitative findings. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA and Pearson product-moment correlations were conducted for statistical analyses while the qualitative data were deductively analysed through a priori theoretical guiding scheme. As a result, the participants were perceived to use oral CSs to some extent, with negotiation for meaning having the top priority. In parallel, as the interview data has shown, the students mentioned using CSs mainly for communication-bound reasons. Moreover, significant differences for CS use appeared only in terms of exposure to English through audio-visual tools in favor of those who reported more frequent exposure. Finally, a positive but weak correlation was calculated between students' overall CS use and oral proficiency scores.},

The study aimed to explore how four in-service English language teachers approach the assessment of students' speaking skill. The data were gathered through classroom observations, interviews, and documentary analysis. Results revealed teachers' preference for summative assessment practices to determine students' progress regarding speaking. As a conclusion, teacher professional development in terms of language assessment may be seen as an alternative to develop significant assessment processes where students, teachers, and the institution can be benefited.},

However, most studies on GR have focused on primary schools, specifically the Foundation Phase. Therefore, this study employed the GR approach to examine its possible effects on the reading proficiencies of Grade 9 English Second Language (ESL) learners in Gauteng province. Social and cognitive constructivism underpinned the study, which employed action research to determine the possible effects of implementing GR on the reading proficiencies of a sample of eight Grade 9 ESL learners who were purposively selected to participate in this study. Data were collected through interviews, observations, and reflection cards, oral and written reading tests. Results indicated that GR approach had caused a significant improvement in these learners' reading fluency and comprehension because of collaborative learning and scaffolding. In addition, GR also developed a sense of ownership in their learning, a sense of community and innovative and inquisitive minds. The study recommends that learners who struggle with reading be identified early, and GR intervention strategies be implemented and monitored. Every school needs to have a reading policy and the Education Department should ensure that it is implemented and monitored.},

The study focuses on improvement of EFL teachers' instructional strategies. The main goal of the study is to develop an EFL instructional framework. The framework consists of SIOP (Sheltered instruction observation protocol) and a backward teaching and learning cycle. The backward cycle is used as a frame to implement the SIOP Model and the reflective coaching. A pilot study is conducted with the Korean teachers who have taught five lessons in order to examine effectiveness of the framework. The pre- and post-evaluation survey data, pre- and post-conference reflections, observation field notes, and five lesson plans are analyzed to see the effectiveness of the instructional framework. The survey results indicate that 26 of 30 items show greater means in the post-evaluation, and 2 items show the statistical significance in the t-test. The results from the five reflective coaching cases illustrate that both participants have reached the reflective thinking stage of experimentation, but only one has reached the evaluation stage, with a new conceptual schemata.

	abstract = {Speaking a foreign language is a complicated process that involves linguistic competence, skills, and strategy use. Communicating through English in English for Academic Purposes courses is a basic requirement for EFL learners, but it can be a challenge. To improve the quality of speech, strengthen components of speaking competence, and raise learner awareness of metacognition, Goh and Burns (2012) propose an integrated pedagogical approach featuring a teaching cycle for developing and assessing students' speaking. The present study accordingly aimed to test how far the teaching-speaking cycle was able to develop low-intermediate Taiwanese EFL university students' speaking ability. Sixty university students participated in the study, which employed a quasi-experimental design. The Experimental Group (EG) received Goh and Burns' integrated pedagogical approach for 18 weeks, whereas the Control Group (CG) simply practiced speaking as regular in-class activities. Speaking tests and questionnaires were used. The results showed that the EG adopted the rehearsal and social strategies more frequently than the CG. In the case of speaking performance, the EG students steadily improved their speaking ability through the semester. The speaking performance of the CG students, however, was limited. A close inspection of the scores revealed marked improvements in particular speaking components for the EG participants.},

Experimental research design was used with an eye to scrutinizing if there was a statistically significant difference between the speaking scores of the participants in the experimental group and the ones got by the participants in the control group. The experimental group had proportionately more lessons conducted by NESTs as opposed to the control group taught predominantly by non-native English-speaking teachers (NNESTs). In eight weeks, marking the duration of the study, the participants submitted three speaking portfolios, took one speaking quiz and one end-of-course test (ECT). Participants' scores on the quiz, the ECT and the speaking portfolios were analyzed via conducting independent samples t-test. The findings obtained from the analyses show that no statistically significant difference exists between the speaking scores of the experimental and control group on the ECT, scores on the speaking quiz, the first and second speaking portfolios while a statistically significant difference is observed between the participants' scores on the third speaking portfolio. The results might arouse suspicion of the popular conception of learning to speak English better as a consequence of being taught by NESTs.},

The validity of task construct and rating rubric went through a process suited for many-facet Rasch measurement supplemented with qualitative interviews. Participants (N = 40) were provided with a video excerpt from a real EFL lesson, and required to deliver a report on the teacher's performance. Two raters graded the records of the candidates' reports using rating scales developed to measure EFL teacher candidates' oral English proficiency and ability to analyze and evaluate teaching. Many-facet Rasch analysis demonstrated a successful estimation, with a noticeable spread among the participants and their traits, proving the task functioned well in measuring candidates' performance and reflecting the difference of their ability. The raters were found to have good internal self-consistency, but not the same leniency. The rating scales worked well, with the average measures advancing largely in line with Rasch expectations. Semi-structured interviews as well as focus group interviews were executed to provide knowledge regarding the raters' performance levels and the functionalities of the rating scale items. The findings provide implications for further research and practice of the Certificate.},

	abstract = {The current study aimed at investigating the possible effects of explicit teaching of affective strategies on Iranian EFL learners' oral language proficiency and the extent of their anxiety in EFL classroom. First, PET test was administered to a total number of 120 female third grade high school EFL students. Then, 60 participants whose score fell within the range of + or - 1 SD from the mean score were selected for the main study. Next, they were randomly assigned into two groups (one control and one experimental). The design of the study was Experimental comparison-group plan. Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale adopted from Horwitz (1986) was used to examine the EFL learners' anxiety level in English class. Moreover, two equivalent oral tests adopted from Heaton (1975) were administered to the participants of the two groups both at the beginning and at the end of the study served as pre and post-tests. The treatment for the experimental group included Oxford's (1990) taxonomy of affective strategies, which included explicit affective strategy instruction (in relaxation, music, visualization, humor, positive self-talk, risk-taking, and monitoring emotions). The control group did not receive any special instruction in terms of affective strategies. To investigate the possible effects of explicit affective strategy use instruction on the participants' oral language proficiency and their anxiety level, the pre and posttests of oral tests and the participants' self-reports of anxiety control in both groups were analyzed and compared. The results of independent samples T-test indicated that while the two groups were homogeneous in terms of oral proficiency and level of anxiety control before introducing the treatment, the experimental group performed better than the control group in the oral post-test. Moreover, the level of anxiety control for the experimental group was significantly different and higher than that of the control group. The results confirm the positive effects of affective strategy instruction on oral language proficiency. The findings of this study provide a greater understanding of affective strategy use among Iranian EFL learners. This study might also have some implications for material developers to consider strategy use in materials development.},

	abstract = {This study aims to analyze the way one EFL teacher maintains and promotes extended student talk in an EFL Listening and Speaking Course at tertiary level via conversation analytic perspective. Promoting extended student turns is one of the main goals of meaning and fluency contexts in language classroom discourse (Seedhouse, 2004), thus, it is of quite importance to study extended student talk in a micro-analytic and detailed way. The data were collected from an EFL class at a private university in Turkey. Listening and Speaking course was audio-recorded for nine classroom hours over five weeks. The data were transcribed using Jefferson transcription system (Jefferson, 2004). The study revealed that the participants systematically follow an organized sequential path leading to extended learner turns. The sequential unfolding of eliciting extended student talk involves alternative questions as a sequence opener and elaboration questions as follow-ups. When students initiate word search sequence, the teacher addresses students' emergent word searches and withholds evaluation turn via minimal response tokens. In addition, on-the-spot decision making such as providing planning time stimulates extended learner talk in subsequent turns. The findings offer some suggestions for the practitioners who would like to promote extended student talk and facilitate learning opportunities in their language classes and contribute to the EFL classroom interaction research.},

APPRAISAL is a descriptive framework of the linguistic resources used to convey feelings and attitudes (Martin \& White, 2005). This topic is particularly interesting in EAP (English for Academic Purposes)/EFL (English as a Foreign Language) contexts where L1 academic language ideologies proscribe the use of APPRAISAL features in scientific prose and where such proscriptions are followed in some disciplines and national contexts. Spanish-speaking countries often exemplify this. Forty Mexican undergraduate EFL students majoring in Health Sciences read two versions of the same short paragraph with different APPRAISAL resources. They were asked to say which of the two versions corresponded to a published research article and why. Evaluation patterns in their answers were analyzed using the attitude system of the APPRAISAL framework (Martin \& White, 2005). The prevalent types of attitudes were valuation and complexity. While most students preferred the more personal text, a minority chose the more impersonal one. The latter group's attitude constructs a language ideology that equates scientific rigor and technicality with impersonal prose; they also show less awareness of the relationship between APPRAISAL resources and writing for specialized audiences.},

After-class practice constitutes an essential component of foreign language learning. This study investigated the effect of utilizing rubrics on EFL learners' oral English using a 16-week experiment and a questionnaire. A total of 61 college students participated in the study, 41 in the rubric-mediated group and 20 in the control group. They were required to complete six tasks of three types: conversation, description, and discussion. Participants in the rubric-mediated group were provided with three rubrics describing respective task assessment criteria. They were also required to record their speaking, self-assess their performance with reference to the rubrics, revise their speaking if they noticed they did not meet the criteria, and finally complete a questionnaire. Students in the control group were assigned the same tasks but were not given the rubrics. Two oral tests were delivered at the initial and final stages of the study to measure the change in their speaking ability. Results revealed that rubrics had positive effects on discourse length, discourse organization, and linguistic flexibility but little impact on linguistic accuracy. Responses to the questionnaire indicated that students perceive rubrics as a facilitative tool of practice and self-assessment.},

	abstract = {This study investigated how task-based learning (TBL) developed the verbal competence of Chinese learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) by employing qualitative and quantitative analyses. We compared the impromptu oral presentations on reading texts of 76 intermediate EFL learners given respectively in the beginning and the end of the 15-week study period at a Taiwanese university. The findings revealed that TBL was effective in fluency, lexical and syntactic complexity, and ineffective in accuracy. Besides, a standardized pretest and a post-test of English proficiency were administered, apart from a students' self-report questionnaire at the end of the experiment. The results of the proficiency exams showed that students made significant improvements in reading and little improvement in listening after TBL. In the self-assessment of the effects of TBL, students felt improvements in vocabulary and pronunciation. Overall, TBL was motivational and useful for language acquisition. Learners' attention was directed to a reading text as a whole for communicative purposes, and therefore their receptive and productive competence was enhanced.},

	abstract = {The ultimate aim of our research project was to use the Google Web Speech API to automate scoring of elicited imitation (EI) tests. However, in order to achieve this goal, we had to take a number of preparatory steps. We needed to assess how accurate this speech recognition tool is in recognizing native speakers' production of the test items; we had to assess its accuracy with our Japanese EFL learners; and, on the basis of these trials, we needed to evaluate the potential for using the API for our purposes. Through comparing our own assessments of the learners' pronunciation with the system's ability to transcribe utterances, we were able to ascertain that the learners' pronunciation of certain sounds is probably the single biggest reason for a fall in recognition accuracy compared to native speaker input. However, we argue that pronunciation may not be an insurmountable barrier to using this speech recognition system for our EFL purposes. By going through this double screening process, we feel we have arrived at a set of items which can be used to assess student's grammatical ability in an EI test using a custom Google Web Speech system.},

	abstract = {While there is general agreement among learners, teachers, and scholars that constructive feedback on writing is necessary to revision, there are fewer consensuses on how feedback should be given, when, by whom, and what sort of feedback is most effective (Weigle, 2014). Providing feedback on writing is generally categorized into three types: written comments, individual conferences, and recorded oral feedback. As the first two types are believed to be very time-consuming and lots of workloads, recording comments, along with the advances in technology over the last decades, has opened new possibilities for feedback in the form of podcasts or other digitally recorded means. In this study, the effect of recorded oral feedback to the writing of the English as a foreign language (EFL) learners was taken into scrutiny. In so doing, two different types of feedback (i.e., audio-recorded comments and metalinguistic written corrective feedback) were given to the learner writing in two groups respectively. The treatment lasted for approximately two months, in which the participants received two different types of feedback to their writing (e.g., recorded oral feedback and metalinguistic written corrective feedback). Results indicated that the group receiving audio-recorded comments on their writing outperformed the latter in their content, and organization, while no significant difference was observed between the two groups in clarity and sentence-level accuracy.},

Spaceteam ESL is a game for mobile devices that involves time-sensitive aural exchanges among players (English learners), with great potential to promote fluency development (via speed) in a non-threatening environment (mediated by the game, a CMC tool). 20 high-beginner/low-intermediate English as a Second Language (ESL) learners participated in the study, divided into two groups: an experimental group (n = 11), which played the game for 15 minutes as a warm-up in class for a period of six weeks, and the control group (n = 9), which was engaged in "traditional" classroom activities such as info gap, story retelling, and other interactive activities for the same period of time. The study followed a mixed-methods design with pre-, post-, and delayed post-tests to measure developments in oral fluency (measured via the computation of number of syllables per second). The results suggest that mobile games such as Spaceteam ESL have the potential to assist in fluency development, but further investigation is needed.

The studies were conducted from April 2014 to January 2015 at a private university in Tokyo, targeting 60 first-year and 25 third-year undergraduates, respectively. In the first study, an assessment of pre- and post-treatment Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) scores revealed students exposed to the flipped lessons improved from a mean of 474 (SD 111) to 649 (SD 96), which was greater than that of the control students who improved from 484 (SD 123) to 617 (SD 115). In the second study, students were exposed to flipped lessons for 24 weeks using a variety of materials such as the "Lecture Ready II" digital text with iPad, COOORI e-learning software for learning words and phrases related to the digital text, ATR CALL Brix e-Learning, Newton e-Learning, and TED Talks. An assessment of pre- and post-treatment TOEIC scores and Oral Proficiency Interview by computer-based (OPIc) speaking test results showed students improved from a mean of 577 (SD 132) to 758 (SD 105), an improvement of 24\% in just the speaking test. Surveys administered after exposure to the flipped lesson activities indicated students were satisfied with their flipped classroom lessons and motivated by the Blended Learning (BL) environment that incorporated mobile learning.

Text reading prosody was assessed by reading aloud task and the students' speaking manner was taped and measured by using the Multidimensional Fluency Scale, as for text comprehension was assessed with a standardized test. It was discovered by the current study that prosody is a reliable sign to determine reading fluency and also reading comprehension. The student who did not read the text prosodically (with appropriate expression) actually showed that he/she failed to comprehend the text. This study also revealed that a struggling reader was also having low comprehension capacity in listening spoken texts. The ESL students' common problems to acquire prosodic reading skill are low exposure to the target language and do not have a good model to imitate prosodic reading.},

Research questions were to see the effects of videoconferencing on the learners' speaking ability and general English language proficiency, and also to see how the learners' international posture changed over time. Eight pairs of Japanese university English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners experienced two semesters of 9-10 videoconferencing sessions per semester with an English teacher living in the Philippines. The task for the pairs was to discuss a social issue together with the teacher once a week. Their goal was to exchange mutual ideas on the designated topic. To lower the anxiety of speaking English as well as to practice discussion with fellow Japanese students, there was a 90-minute preparation period prior to each videoconferencing session. Pre-tests and post-tests results showed significant improvement in fluency, particularly in the amount of speech, and complexity of their speaking abilities. The learners also demonstrated progress in English proficiency. Their international posture stayed at a high level, but did not change much. However, their increased interest in working or participating in volunteer activities overseas was observed. The results indicated that the instruction based on videoconferencing helped improve learners' language and their global mind as a part of international posture.

	abstract = {Cleveland Metropolitan School District (CMSD) has witnessed an increase in the number of English learner students in grades K-12 over recent years, with students coming from more diverse backgrounds in race/ethnicity, countries of origin, and native language. This requires more support from the district to meet diverse needs in terms of languages, cultures, and educational supports. The Cleveland Partnership for English Learner Success--a partnership among CMSD's Multilingual Multicultural Education office, the research office and researchers from Regional Educational Laboratory Midwest--has prioritized identifying English learner student and school characteristics associated with student achievement and language proficiency. This will provide a step toward improving district and school supports for English learner students. Student and school data from 2011/12 through 2016/17 were obtained from the district administrative records. The study examined means and percentages of student and school characteristics and student achievement of English learner students in grades 3-8 from school years 2011/12 through 2016/17. The study team examined these characteristics for English learner students in grades 3-8 each year separately, enabling the team to identify stable patterns while helping to uncover changes over time. To explore associations with achievement, the study developed a series of regression models that correlated student and school characteristics with student performance on statewide assessments while controlling for other key characteristics. The study focused on the most recent year of English learner outcomes available--2016/17--to provide information that was most relevant to the current English learner student population and educational setting. Between 2011/12 and 2016/17, English learner students in the district increasingly spoke languages other than Spanish. The percentage of English learner students enrolled in the district newcomer academy increased, while the percentage of English learner students enrolled in bilingual schools decreased. The study also found that English learner students increasingly were enrolled in schools with school climate scores higher than the district average over the study period, and that the newcomer academy consistently had school climate scores more than a standard deviation above the district average. Student special education status and lower prior year assessment performance were consistently associated with lower current student performance. English learner students speaking Arabic tended to have lower levels of English language proficiency, while gifted and female students tended to have higher English language proficiency. Students had lower mathematics achievement when they attended a school with larger numbers of English learner students per bilingual paraprofessional, and lower speaking proficiency levels when attending schools with larger numbers of students per certified ESL teacher, but these school staffing characteristics were not clearly associated with the other student outcomes studied. School climate domains were positively associated with student speaking proficiency levels, but not with most other student outcomes. The study findings suggest further work to gain a deeper understanding of how school climate may support English learner student language proficiency and achievement; examining how specialized schools like the district's newcomer academy may support positive school climate; and considering the role of staff specialized to work with English learner students.},

We analyse data provided by the National Education and Evaluation Development Unit (NEEDU) of South Africa, which tested 4,667 Grade 5 ESL students from 214 schools from rural areas in South Africa in 2013. This included ORF and comprehension measures for a subset of 1,772 students. We found that 41\% of the sample were non-readers in English ({\textless}40 words correct per minute, or WCPM) and only 6\% achieved comprehension scores above 60\%. By calibrating comprehension levels and WCPM rates, we developed tentative benchmarks and argue that a range of 90-100 WCPM in English is acceptable for Grade 5 ESL students in South Africa. In addition, we outline policy priorities for remedying the reading crisis in the country.},

	abstract = {Much research has investigated the role of planning time in second language writing; however, the results show that there are inconsistent findings about the effects of planning time conditions on the complexity of the EFL learners' textual output. The current study attempted to consider the differential effects of planning time conditions in terms of the pre-task planning condition, the online planning condition, and the no planning condition on the complexity of writings composed by means of an argumentative task from 90 EFL learners. The results reveal that the pre-task planning condition had a marked effect on syntactic complexity and syntactic variety, but the online planning condition only benefited syntactic complexity. Rather unexpectedly, the three planning time conditions showed practically similar performance in lexical variety. The results indicate that pre-task and online planning had remarkable effects on the production of language that was more complex and syntactically varied, however, these two types of planning did not benefit lexical variety. In addition, through a consideration of Yuan and Ellis (2003) and Ellis and Yuan (2004), regarding the effects of planning on oral and written narratives, the researcher compared the results of the study to those previous and, finally, provided pedagogical implications on language practitioners and testers.},

The main objectives were: (1) to analyze current practices from the perspectives of teachers and students, (2) to identify real problems encountered by teachers and students attempting to embrace Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) to improve oral English communication, and (3) propose practical solutions for classroom practices to improve the majority of students' oral proficiency from the elementary level. The findings were that oral English communication classes at PSU continue to embrace CLT and that the majority of Thai A2 students were frequently engaged in group activities rather than in individual and teacher-centered tasks. There was reliance on unrealistic, scripted role plays. Unlike the Serbian students, Thai students apparently needed to acquire more independent skills, become less passive learners, and interact more spontaneously in the target language. Other problems at PSU included mixed ability classes. Recommendations are placement tests, choices of more advanced elective courses, rigorous enforcement of upper enrollment limit, a balance between group and individual communicative tasks, and replacement of scripted with non-scripted role plays.},

The goal of the study is to identify patterns that characterize the trajectory that language learners move through in terms of their use of phrasal and clausal grammatical complexity, as mediated by mode (spoken and written) and task type (independent and integrated). Results of a multidimensional analysis reveal that in many cases, learners developed in expected ways: discourse styles at Time 1 were not always aligned with mode- and task type-specific discourse patterns but developed over time, with discourse styles at Time 2 better approximating expected norms and exhibiting increased task differentiation. These changes were particularly noteworthy for Dimension 1, which is related to phrasal and clausal complexity. Results of a developmental complexity analysis revealed more mixed results, seeming to indicate that the relatively low-proficiency learners represented by the longitudinal corpus may just be beginning on the hypothesized paths of development. The most important developments occurred for independent writing, in which students exhibited increases in the frequency of phrasal features, as well as functional expansion in the use of a range of complexity features.},

Secondly, the student participants' first language (L1; e.g., Farsi) learner identities were operationalized, especially focusing on the skill of writing, WCF, and grammar-centred WCF. Thirdly, the students' affective engagement with WCF was scrutinized, particularly in light of L1 student identities. The participants in the study were 15 students in an Iranian EFL context. Analysis of interview data revealed that the skill of writing was held in low regard by the students. Also, several discrepancies emerged vis-à-vis WCF methods (e.g., direct vs. coded), error correctors (e.g., teacher feedback vs. peer feedback), the amount of correction (e.g., selective vs. comprehensive correction), and the relative importance of different components of writing (e.g., grammar vs. content vs. organization). In particular, the findings showed that the students' L1 identities involved low regard for writing, but high regard for speaking skills, and that they attached high value to grammatical accuracy and teacher explicit feedback. Finally, the findings indicated that: (a) the students' second language (L2) identities (e.g., WCF-related preferences) were profoundly affected by their L1 student identities, and (b) the discrepancies between the students' L2 writing preferences (e.g., preferred amount of WCF) and the teachers' reported practices could potentially hinder students' affective engagement with WCF.},

	abstract = {In the light of continuous change of global perspectives, current educational contexts have been evolving to cover the necessary 21st century skills that the individuals must acquire. Two of the 4Cs (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration and communication) of the 21st century educational trends; creativity and creative thinking are the key characteristics of the learners. Considering as one of the requirements of the global communication, knowing and learning a foreign language should keep up with the current improvements in the field of education. Language learners should think critically and creatively in order to communicate with people to enhance the global collaboration. The purpose of this study is to enhance students' creative thinking skills through appropriate training and to understand the effectiveness of the stimuli type--visual or audio. A pre-experimental research design was chosen for the implementation of the training program. Two different groups--visual and audio--were given either visual or audio stimuli at the beginning of creative thinking tasks. 12 participants were chosen via convenience sampling for each group and the ages of the learners are between 12-13. The training continued for 6 weeks and the participants took 3 hours of training were week. Each training session covered creative thinking tasks which were adapted or designed for the development of creative thinking skills--fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration. A task-based pretest was implemented before the treatment and the students' creative thinking skills were measured through figural, written and oral tests and the post-test was implemented to check the effectiveness of the training program. The results were scored by two different raters and the scores were analyzed through SPSS program. The results indicate that the creative thinking capacity of both groups has improved however the visual group students have higher creative thinking after the completion of the training program. This study suggests that although regarded as a higher level of reasoning, creative thinking can be enhanced to some extent among the secondary school learners of English and it should be a part of EFL curriculum as an essential learning skill.

While the quality of textbooks has improved dramatically in recent years, the process of selecting an appropriate textbook has not become any easier for most teachers and administrators. The past decade has also seen considerable changes in the use of English that present new challenges for ELT as well. Since speaking fluently and accurately has become the most expected result in language learning, speaking sections of the course books have been basis for course book selection. Since a criterion is needed to evaluate course books, the Common European Framework provides a common basis for the elaboration of language syllabuses, curriculum guidelines, examinations, textbooks, etc. across Europe (CoE, 2001). It also describes in a comprehensive way what language learners have to learn to do in order to use a language for communication and what knowledge and skills they have to develop so as to be able to act effectively. In this study, two course books, Yeni Hitit 1 and Success in TFL and EFL context respectively have been evaluated in the way it handles and practices speaking skill across self-assessment of CEFR. It is found that these books give priority to different issues.},

Based on my experience and the research literature, several types of feedback should be administered by teachers to create more effective learning opportunities among advanced ESL writing students. In this paper, I examine the advantages and disadvantages of three main types of feedback: peer feedback, teacher feedback and online feedback with anonymity used in university advanced ESL writing courses. I also present evidence as to which types of feedback are the most effective, how online feedback with anonymity plays an important role in processing peer feedback and how feedback should be administered. I conclude that among advanced ESL writing students written feedback with oral explanations will improve the accuracy of writing faster than only providing written feedback. At the same time, online feedback with anonymity will encourage students to provide more objective feedback than class discussion. I will illustrate what I consider to be an effective feedback which will conclude as my suggested model.},

Then they were equally distributed in two control and experimental groups and received a validated pretest of reading aloud and speaking in English. Afterward, the treatment was performed in 18 sessions by singing preselected songs culled based on some criteria such as popularity, familiarity, amount, and speed of speech delivery, etc. In the end, the posttests of reading aloud and speaking in English were administered. The results revealed that the treatment had statistically positive effects on the connected speech aspects of English learners' speech production at statistical 0.05 level of significance. Meanwhile, the results represented that there was not any significant difference between the experimental group's mean scores on the posttests of reading aloud and speaking. It was thus concluded that providing the EFL learners with English verbal songs could positively affect connected speech aspects of both modes of speech production, reading aloud and speaking. The Findings of this study have pedagogical implications for language teachers to be more aware and knowledgeable of the benefits of verbal songs to promote speech production of language learners in terms of naturalness and fluency.},

A corpus of Vietnamese accented English speech designed to elicit a careful but unguarded style of speaking was collected from 16 Vietnamese overseas students studying at an Australian University. Listeners of various L1 language backgrounds (Australian English [n= 125], Vietnamese [n=10], Chinese [n=10], Arabic [n=8], Japanese [n= 10], other=7), of varying exposure and fluency in English judged the intelligibility, the strength of foreign accent, and attempted to transcribe the test utterances in a self-paced speech recognition task. From this database it was possible to estimate (for the first time) realistic intelligibility estimates of Vietnamese accented English under conditions that approximate normal connected speech, and also to estimate the effects of the listener's language background in interaction with their comprehension proficiency in the target language (Australian English). Implications for English language teaching, particularly pronunciation pedagogy in TESOL teacher training programs are discussed.},

	abstract = {Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) applications have come into focus as potential tools to improve English language instruction, and teachers can engage more students from different backgrounds in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classes thanks to MIM apps' distinctive features, like WhatsApp. Most of the reported studies on the use of WhatsApp in the teaching of foreign languages were performed in university or adult learning environments. The present study explores how social and emotional engagement manifest themselves in a popular instant messaging application group (WhatsApp) used by teenagers learning EFL. A focus group, a Likert scale survey, and a transcript of the WhatsApp chat were the three main sources from which data was gathered. Members' interaction records were retrieved and inductive thematic analysis was used to examine them. These findings suggest that WhatsApp provided communicative opportunities to all students, including those who did not fully engage. However, further research with a larger number of students in different contexts is necessary.

	abstract = {Whilst teaching and learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) rightly focuses on meaningful and purposeful transactional language use, interpersonal language is often downplayed or given cursory treatment even though it is an equally essential and perhaps even more fulfilling dimension of target language interaction. Interpersonal language as expressed through small talk, for instance, represents an important personal and interactional resource for establishing, developing, and maintaining relationships. However, small talk is often reduced to formulaic categorisation or practised through routinised communicative functions. To understand how foreign language users engage in small talk, a qualitative study was carried out through conducting participation-observations. The results of this study reveal the exploratory, celebratory, and supportive relational dimensions to small talk and illustrate how such insights can be exploited in FL teaching and learning. In this article, we argue that small talk should be appreciated, valued, and accentuated not only for its ability to enhance meaningful and productive communication but also needs to be exploited for its exploratory, celebratory, and supportive interactive function.},

Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) applications are on the frontline as one of the most widely used social networking platforms holding great potential for language learning and teaching. This preliminary study tries to understand if Spanish teenagers and young adults who study English as a Foreign Language (EFL) consider MIM as a significant learning platform that can help improve and support their language learning skills. The survey target participants were 22 students, aged 13 to 18, who study EFL as an extracurricular activity in a private language school. This study suggests that MIMs can be useful support tools and motivating for students. It also shows willingness of participants towards the use of MIM in their classroom.

Although existing literature suggests that coaching in pre-service teacher programs is relatively uncommon, the limited research on its use is promising. This exploratory case study examined one coaching partnership between a pre-service English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher and an English language teaching (ELT) faculty member during a course for adult paraprofessional educators learning to take an exam required for teaching licensure. The results of a qualitative document analysis of reflective writing, email correspondence and an audio-recorded phone conversation suggest that instructional coaching supported the pre-service ESL teacher through the use of unique coaching elements, including modeling, a window on the coach's reflective process, opportunities to request specific feedback and the coach's familiarity with the pre-service teacher's students. The coaching partnership also provided an opportunity for the ELT faculty member to grow professionally. Our findings point to the importance of positive interpersonal dynamics in the coaching relationship and the need for clear goal setting, expectations and scheduling logistics.},

These tasks which intend to assist EFL teachers in the promotion of interactions and particularly negotiation for meaning (NfM) in virtual classes. Seven tasks are included, six of which are adaptations of the tasks that were used in the previous studies that explored NfM. The seven tasks were modified since they were originally designed to be carried out in face-to-face interactions, but our objective is to encourage virtual NfM. To this end, we include a review of the literature that will serve as the rationale behind each task, and we also provide the details regarding their implementation in virtual classes.},

Chat conversation was assumed as the medium through which the teacher provides corrective feedback to the students. Five ESL teachers were interviewed for the study. The data gathered were analysed qualitatively using an affinity diagram which is discussed under an inductive thematic analysis. Findings of the study suggest that there is potential for provision of SCMCF through chat conversations, for teachers believe that SCMCF will improve language skills of the students; moreover, this approach needs only a limited use of technology. However, it was revealed that there could be some complexities, mainly due to teachers' existing workloads, some ethical aspects, and the low level of technology that is available in certain universities.

This study was conducted to develop a description of spoken English with a special focus on DMs to investigate their functions and frequencies in Iranian non-native discourse and was conducted across 30 EFL teachers and 30 EFL learners. Spoken samples were gathered from the participants in the context of the classroom. Fung and Carter's (2007) framework was adopted for the analysis of DMs. The results showed no significant gender difference in terms of frequency of using DMs with different functions between learners and also teachers. In investigating the effect of proficiency level on using the markers among learners, advanced learners were found to use more interpersonal DMs than intermediates. At this intermediate level, male learners used fewer interpersonal DMs than female learners, but, at the advanced level, males used more DMs than females. Implications for teachers and researchers are mentioned.},

The study employed the CQ scale to detect learners' CQ, and open-ended questions to unearth strengths and weaknesses. SPSS was run for quantitative analysis, whereas MAXQDA was tapped for qualitative data analysis. The results indicated high values for students' metacognitive, motivational, and behavioural CQ, albeit learners' cognitive CQ was moderate. There was no significant difference between the CQ of male and female students. Moreover, the overseas experience did not have a significant influence on their CQ. However, there was a significant difference in the cognitive CQ of students at different proficiency levels. Qualitative analysis revealed learners' strengths, such as communication and adaptation skills, and an interest in diverse cultures. However, learners' scant knowledge of different cultures and low language proficiency were significant problems impeding learners' intercultural communication. The implications of the study might provide insight for stakeholders to raise students' CQ in educational spheres.},

	abstract = {This article develops a complex understanding of safe space in relation to adult refugee learners' oral literacy practice of telling stories of violent life experiences in English as a second language (ESL) classrooms. A rhizoanalytic approach brings theoretical and empirical elements into conversation to ask two questions. Can the exigencies of safe classroom spaces accommodate the telling/hearing of violent stories? What might be the pedagogical potential of such storytelling in ESL classrooms? Grounded in literature critiquing safe space discourses and theoretical work that views the telling of violent stories as ambivalent (destructive and productive), I argue that unproblematic conceptualizations of safe classrooms become impossible when refugees are involved. I present a data assemblage drawn from a qualitative study with two ESL teachers and four students. In a series of interview vignettes, the students describe their experiences of hearing their classmates' stories of violence, highlighting the emotional impact of these experiences and their capacity to bring on new ways of thinking. This analysis reframes refugee storytellers as powerful, agentive forces in the ESL classroom and suggests that sharing stories is pedagogical in the sense that it affects and transforms learners. In closing, I discuss the practical and ethical implications of the research.},

Moreover, the possible moderating effect of learners' proficiency level was examined. Four groups of 30 female Iranian learners of English in a language school participated in this study, two of which were chosen from upper-intermediate learners, while the other two groups included learners studying at pre-intermediate levels. The results of the two-way ANCOVA tests indicated that cognitive scaffolding could foster speaking skill and its components. Besides, it was found that learners' level of proficiency did not mediate the impact of scaffolding on the studied dependent variables. Therefore, both upper-intermediate and pre-intermediate learners equally benefited from cognitive scaffolds. The study offers a number of pedagogical implications which are discussed.},

Therefore, the current study intends to present the tests of reliability and validity for the Children's Foreign Language Anxiety Scale (CFLAS) and to report on the reliability, validity and factor structure of the scale.

An EFL classroom provides an environment that promotes use of the target language, yet Thai learners are often reluctant to communicate in English in the classroom. The present study aimed to investigate the possible factors that influence Thai learners' WTC in the EFL classroom context. Participants included Thai students in both the Thai and International Engineering programs at a public university in Bangkok, Thailand, as well as both Thai and foreign instructors. The assumption underlying the investigation was that WTC in English in the classroom of Thai students in both Thai and international programs was is influenced by variables other than their English proficiency. Likert-type WTC questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data, and a quantitative descriptive approach was employed. Content analysis was also used to analyze qualitative data and provide more in-depth answers to the research questions. Statistically significant differences in WTC between Thai EFL learners in the Thai and international programs were found both in degrees of willingness and reported factors influencing the WTC. The results have been used to develop evidence-based guidelines for English instructors in the implementation of classroom activities and teaching methods to promote Thai learners' WTC in the classroom.},

The objective is to document which conversational strategies these learners use and to compare them to those previously reported for other populations. The analysis of our data shows that these children negotiate significantly less than other populations but use a variety of strategies to negotiate for meaning. Also, they resort to the L1 on some occasions and use explicit correction quite often. In light of these results we will argue in favour of using these types of interactive activities in the classroom.},

The paradigm of Action Research was used as a framework to reflect on the strengths of the program and to identify activities that engaged the students and contributed to improved language skills. Supplementary assignments of a Young Adult novel and provocative movies, used across both the ESL and Sociology class, helped students to apply abstract concepts to familiar situations. The structure of the link produced an effective learning community and a support system for the students. We suggest that linking ESL to a content course might be preferable to other options for developmental ESL students entering college.},

The teacher wrote three reflective journals (before, midway, and after the study) and kept weekly pre- and post-class lesson journals in which she documented and reflected on the ways she provided oral CF to a group of adult learners in a synchronous computer-mediated context (SCMC). Both the reflective journals and lesson journals underwent multiple rounds of qualitative coding, identifying the areas of the teacher's CF foci--themes of CF provision (in terms of type, quantity, and timing), perceptions of student engagement with the provided feedback, and ways she strategized her lesson plans to promote CF provision. Results showed changes in how the teacher adjusted her lesson plans to promote specific CF types and increase the saliency of the feedback she provided but solidification of the type and target type (i.e., a propensity for recasts and grammatical corrections), amount, and timing of her CF provision. The findings build upon results of previous studies by mirroring divergence between the teacher's beliefs and practices and exploring the factors that motivated the teacher to adjust her CF practices.},

Two classes received two-week sentence-making practice, before completing the questionnaire designed specifically for the present study and attending the semi-structured interview. The descriptive statistics and independent t-test demonstrate that both mean scores of two classes are below 3 points, showing that they are in low or moderate anxiety levels. Moreover, the mean scores of HI class are lower than LI class in all four dimensions (classroom experience; while-writing experience; feedback experience; further effects), despite no significant difference, except for in the third dimension (feedback experience). Both statistic results and qualitative analysis with learners' attitudes towards sentence-making practice illustrate that the learners in two classes have less writing anxiety after sentence-making practice, and this teaching method has also brought beneficial effects on learners' writing.},

While I was first settling in Korea, I got acquainted with a few students and other young adults who liked to talk with and assist English speaking foreigners. They made such a strong impression that I remembered them and thought about our conversations over the years. I ended up writing about them, imagining their real life situations as they had confided in me, or envisioned how their lives would proceed thereafter. I interwove their narrations with my narration of my experience with them to put myself in the shoes of others. This collection thereby serves as a journalistic reflection of some of my first encounters with such students of English as well as a preservation of memories. Given the artistic approach to this work, it is not standard social science although it is a useful exploratory activity, and can be used as one tool of reflective practice in educating, understanding, or relating to a particular cultural group as an outsider.

This paper addresses this gap by analysing the similarities and differences in the task-related strategies of twenty children aged 8 and 9 and fourteen adult L1-Spanish EFL learners at low levels of competence in paired interaction. Results provide evidence of clear age-related differences, as adults were more consistent and approached the task in a more predictable and efficient fashion.

	abstract = {Adult education's mission is a critical one. It seeks to provide the large and diverse population of adults who lack basic skills, a high school credential, or English language skills with the competencies they need to be productive workers, family members, and citizens. Federally funded adult education serves learners in three types of programs: adult basic education, adult secondary education, and English as a second language. Nearly 43 million U.S. adults lack the basic English literacy skills required to succeed in the workforce and achieve economic self-sufficiency. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is the key federal investment helping adults acquire these and other important skills, as well as to earn a high school equivalency credential. WIOA encourages adult education programs to use evidence-based strategies to improve services and participant success. This systematic research review suggests a need for more rigorous studies, as there is not yet much evidence to guide decision making around instructional and support strategies for adult learners. Title II of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 directs the federal government to conduct a national assessment of adult education, including activities to understand the extent to which adult education strategies positively affect learners. A systematic review of the research on the effectiveness of particular strategies in adult education is one way in which the U.S. Department of Education is fulfilling this need. This snapshot reports on that systematic review. This is the first review of a broad set of strategies in adult education to apply the standards and procedures of the U.S. Department of Education's What Works Clearinghouse. It summarizes for policymakers and local providers the evidence base for many of the strategies authorized under Title II. It is designed to identify which strategies have evidence of effectiveness and where gaps appear in the evidence base. With this information, policymakers and practitioners can better understand the extent to which evidence supports particular strategies and which areas require additional studies.

Objectives: This article considered the perceptions of a cohort of third-year undergraduates of the Department of Communication and Language Arts, University of Ibadan, Nigeria, on the relationship between exposure to blended learning (BL) and the development of online critical literacy skills. Method: A BL mode, which took the form of a face-to-face approach and the use of a virtual learning environment, was employed in teaching Critical Literacy, a component of the Developmental Reading Skills course designed for undergraduates of English as a second language. For 4 weeks, 80 students were trained to read web-based information critically and evaluate web pages in the Developmental Reading course, after which their perception of the relationship between exposure to BL and the development of online critical literacy skills was investigated. This work, for which data were obtained through focus group discussion and administration of a structured questionnaire, is grounded in both critical literacy (Janks 2013) and social constructivist theories (McInerney \& McInerney 2002). Frequency distribution and Pearson correlation coefficient were employed in analysing the data collected. Results: The results revealed that the students perceived a positive relationship between exposure to BL and the development of online critical literacy skills. Conclusion: Many of the respondents showed a preference for the BL mode, and the benefits they derived from it include: the improvement of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills, the acquisition of more knowledge after the class, convenient time to work and ease with self-expression.},

The research is built on qualitative data collected through the analysis of evaluation questionnaires and reflection exercises administered on the completion of the course. The aspects explored include the reasons for the high level of dropouts, the importance of maintaining social presence in the virtual learning environment, the learners' cognitive frustration caused by the use of the inductive approach (namely guided discovery on an online platform), and the activities that can foster communication among the learners and encourage them to build a strong and supportive community. Taken together, the results highlight the importance of administering pre-course surveys, adjusting the teaching methodology to the learners' past learning experience and maintaining interaction among the learners. The research will benefit teaching English as a foreign language specialists and curriculum designers engaged in the field of online teaching. The results of the research will be invested in improving the overall quality of the further stages of the programme.

	abstract = {Increasing EFL learners' willingness to communicate has always been a concern to teachers. This study aimed at investigating the effect of extended wait time in EFL classrooms on the learners' willingness to communicate. In order to carry out this quasi-experimental study, 60 adult EFL learners at a basic level of proficiency in English (CEFR A1 and A2) were chosen to take part. They were first homogenised by Key English Test (KET) and then assigned to two groups of experimental and control. The Willingness to Communicate (WTC) Questionnaire by McIntyre, Baker, Clément, and Conrod (2001) was given to learners before the treatment. During the treatment phase, in the experimental group, the teacher allocated more wait time (3-5 seconds) to the learners when a question was asked, however, in the control group, wait time was limited (less than 3 seconds). After the treatment phase, the WTC questionnaire was administered again to find out if it altered as a result of the treatment. The results show that those learners who were in the experimental group showed higher willingness to communicate compared to lower WTC scores in the limited wait time group participants. The findings can make ELT teachers aware that giving their students more time to think can increase their willingness to communicate in the second language.},

	abstract = {Youth in middle and secondary grades, between childhood and the adult world, sometimes struggle with their identities as readers and learners. Too many describe themselves or are described by their teachers and parents as "reluctant, disengaged, and/or unmotivated" by classroom texts or by the rows of books in school libraries. Even though blockbuster series have powered young adult fiction and cinematic markets over the last two decades (e.g., "Harry Potter" "The Hunger Games" "Diary of a Wimpy Kid"), "I don't like to read" is nevertheless a common refrain in schools and in homes. In terms of teaching English as a foreign language (EFL), the communicative language teaching paradigms that have long dominated the field tend to downplay literacy as a focus in preference for conceptualizing language as distinct if overlapping skill sets of reading, writing, and listening. Whether a student did or did not like reading has historically been of less concern to a field more focused on communicative language development. Yet, with more contemporary proponents of "literacy" arguing the multidimensional, multimodal, and existential ways of reading the "word/world" as an alternative ( Freire 2000; Heath 1983; Paris 2011), the concept of literacy has slowly begun entering the professional lexicon of TESOL (Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages) International Association and other leading English language teaching professional organizations; in addition, the "power of reading" is an emerging centerpiece of primary and secondary curricular paradigms (see Fay and Whaley 2004; Krashen 1993). In this article, the authors argue that how adolescent language learners position themselves as readers does matter to teachers of EFL and that teachers do not have to accept a student's declaration of "I don't like to read" as a permanent reality. Schools, and English language classrooms in particular, can promote a culture of reading that forwards a communicative paradigm and at the same time embraces literacy as a "system for representing the world to ourselves--a psychological phenomenon; at the same time it is a system for representing the world to others--a social phenomenon" (Barton 1994, 33). Specifically, they outline in practical ways the potential of applied theatre for stimulating purposeful, creative literacy engagement with adolescent learners in order to engage communication in multiple modalities and in interactive ways. They begin with a brief overview of applied theatre and contemporary theorizations of its relationship to literacy development. Next, they provide a description of four approaches for activating applied theatre for literacy development, using Shel Silverstein's (1964) "The Giving Tree" as an anchor example. They conclude with special attention to how applied theatre might be leveraged across grade levels in diverse classroom settings and adapted for varied genres and forms of text.},

Besides, there have been few, if any, studies exploring the relationship between learners' use of metacognitive reading strategies and their performance in reading tests. The aim of this study is thus to investigate not only the impact of online reading tasks on tertiary level EFL students' test scores at a Public University in Turkey but also the role of metacognitive reading strategies they used on their test scores. A total of 51 Turkish-speaking adult learners took part in this study--25 of them were in the experimental group who were assigned online reading tasks during the term, and another 26 students were in the control group who continued reading on paper. A pre-test and a post-test, which were paper-based, were given to the two groups consisting of 20 multiple choice and lasting 30 minutes each. To detect the learners' metacognitive reading strategies, Turkish version of Mokhtari and Reichard's (2002) Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies was conducted. The pre- and post-test scores of experiment and control group and their responses to the survey were statistically analyzed through SPSS version 20.0. The results indicated that there was not a significant difference between test scores of experiment and control group after 6-week treatment. Besides, a one-way ANOVA revealed that none of the strategies was favored by the learners. As such, the results showed that online reading tasks and reading strategies did not show any effect on learners' reading comprehensions. It was implicated in the study that stakeholders should be cautioned about the use of technology in the language classroom and expectances regarding online reading tasks potential to bring about changes in reading scores.},

To date, IH has not been explicitly researched as a variable in the study of foreign language (FL) learning. The present mixed-methods study aims to explore possible links between FL learners' IH and their foreign language enjoyment (FLE) and foreign language classroom anxiety (FLCA). The survey was administered online entirely in Spanish and respondents were 163 adult Spanish L1 speakers enrolled in an EFL course at any level of proficiency. The research instrument was adapted from three established constructs: the CIHS (Comprehensive Intellectual Humility Scale) (Krumrei-Mancuso \& Rouse, 2016), the FLE Short Form (Botes, Dewaele \& Greiff, 2020) and the FLCA Short form scale (Dewaele \& MacIntyre, 2014). Feedback on three open-ended questions provided qualitative data. Results show that IH has a mixed and complex relationship with FLE and FLCA, with some IH domains negatively predicting FLE and both positively and negatively predicting FLCA. The current research is an attempt to widen the range of psychological factors that might affect FL classroom emotions.},

	abstract = {We explore the potential of a computer-adaptive decoding game in Spanish to increase the decoding skills and oral reading fluency in Spanish and English of bilingual students. Participants were 78 first-grade Spanish-speaking students attending bilingual programs in five classrooms in Texas. Classrooms were randomly assigned to the treatment (i.e., where students played Graphogame Spanish) for 16 weeks for ten minutes per day (n = 3) versus business as usual instruction (n = 2). Results indicate that students at some risk on Spanish pseudoword reading appeared to benefit the most from playing the game. Analysis of gains suggests a potentially small, but meaningful educational effect of the game on Spanish oral reading fluency and English pseudoword reading when taking Spanish decoding skills at pretest into account. Students indicated that they enjoyed playing the game, and that the game helped them improve their reading skills. Teachers perceived the game as an engaging tool for students to use during small-group instruction or during independent time in a Response-to-Intervention approach. We discuss our mixed results in the context of using computer-adaptive games to improve the academic outcomes of bilingual students.

Thus, these apps provide a very flexible form of learning that is also practical, interactive, adaptive, dynamic and deeply rooted in daily sociocultural situations and contexts. In particular, our study has aimed at designing and implementing an app to help its users create and perform successful business presentations. Thus, the potential users of our app are both professionals and students in general, since business presentations are a compulsory and essential activity in most professional environments nowadays. Using our app will allow them to learn these skills ubiquitously and autonomously, since it contains self-evaluating (automatically corrected) exercises.

This process is underscored by two important innovations: (a) a basis in a well-established human cognitive architecture in terms of cognitive load theory; and (b) point-of-contact feedback based in a well-tested online system dedicated to enhancing the learning process. Analysis of preliminary trials suggests that the DBIR approach to the ngMOOC construction and development supports theoretical standpoints that argue for an understanding of how design for optimal learning can utilise conditions, such as differing online or blended educational contexts, in order to be effective and scalable. The ngMOOC development described in this paper marks the adoption of a cognitive architecture in conjunction with feedback systems, offering the groundwork for use of adaptive systems that cater for learner expertise. This approach seems especially useful in constructing and developing online learning that is self-paced and curriculum-based.},

It also investigated students' attitudes to the LMOOC. The research was conducted with a sample of 178 university students enrolled in a compulsory academic English course, English for Academic Studies. Following the pre-test, in which students delivered an oral presentation, they participated in a five-week LMOOC on English presentation skills, integrated as a blended component of their course. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, post-test scores were analyzed, comparing students' performance gains from the pre-test to the post-test. Additionally, students' attitudes towards the PLP were explored through a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Students demonstrated statistically significant gains in post-test scores across both presentation performance and language proficiency metrics, with greater improvements observed in language proficiency criteria. However, while the pronunciation criterion also showed statistically significant gains, the effect size was small, suggesting a limited practical impact. This finding underscores the need for more explicit instruction and targeted feedback to enhance pronunciation development in the learning process. The students generally expressed positive attitudes toward both the PLP and the LMOOC implementation. The findings suggest that when pedagogically designed and systematically implemented, a PLP within an LMOOC can serve as an effective approach for enhancing oral presentation skills and may contribute positively to the overall language learning experience.},

	abstract = {During spoken interaction with peers, ESL or ELF learners use peer feedback to negotiate and converge on mutually intelligible pronunciation. In contrast, for EFL learners who interact mainly with same-L1 peers, it is not clear whether the giving and receiving of peer feedback on intelligibility can facilitate uptake leading to improved pronunciation. However, it has been suggested that same-L1 learner pronunciation feedback requires ample time and a narrow focus, conditions that could be realized in a CMC environment. This study investigates the effect of modality--face-to-face (FtoF) or computer-mediated (CMC)--of peer feedback on the intelligibility of 83 Japanese university students' /l/ and /r/ in four target words. After discrimination and pronunciation training, treatment consisted of participants making peer intelligibility judgments in two modalities. The FtoF group pronounced and provided immediate feedback in pairs, while the CMC group recorded utterances that were randomly delivered to peers for asynchronous intelligibility judgements. The participants' pre-, post-, and delayed posttest recordings (956 utterances) were rated for intelligibility. For each target word, Generalized Estimating Equations examined the effect of group, initial discrimination ability, change in listening discrimination ability, and initial pronunciation confidence. The CMC group was significantly more likely to be intelligible for post-treatment singleton-/r/ and delayed posttreatment /l/-clusters. The results suggest that, depending on the intended target, intelligibility feedback from same-L1 peers in a CMC environment does not hinder and may promote pronunciation development.},

Specifically, eye gaze was identified as a signal for turn-taking, turn-yielding, and turn-denying, whose absence hindered learners' ability to interpret their peers' and teachers' intentions and expectations. The paper concludes with pedagogical implications for technologists, software developers, students, language teachers, and language teacher educators.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that social media has been used by students to develop speaking skills. Nevertheless, precisely how guided social media (GSM) (usage determined by the instructor) and unguided social media (USM) (freely chosen by students) activities in speaking courses affect their speaking skills and willingness to communicate (WTC) remain unclear. It also remains uncertain what social and emotional learning (SEL) factors during the adoption of social media-assisted language learning (SMALL) help to facilitate student learning. Therefore, this study purposed to investigate (1) the effects of GSM and USM on English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students' speaking performance and WTC and (2) the SEL factors that enable students to thrive during SMALL activities. This study employed a mixed-methods experimental approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data. This study used intact group sampling to recruit Indonesian EFL students who were studying at a state university and formed three groups based on existing classes, as designated by university. The classes included two experimental groups, namely USM (20 students) and GSM (23 students), as well as a control group (26 students). The quantitative data were analyzed using "Kruskal-Wallis" and "Mann-Whitney U" tests while the qualitative data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. The results indicated that USM and GSM significantly improved EFL students' speaking performance. However, only USM significantly improved WTC. In addition, students' SEL in SMALL was influenced by factors such as learning engagement, motivation, learning environment, and support.},

	abstract = {The abrupt shift of teaching and learning to the online mode due to the COVID-19 outbreak has inevitably called for technology integration to better engage students in online instruction. This call includes the possibility to enact podcast in an English as a foreign language (EFL) class, particularly in speaking. However, despite the increasing number of studies on the benefits of podcasting for language teaching and learning, little attention has been paid to EFL students' engagement in self-created podcast at the micro-level of instruction. Thus, this study aimed to fill this void by enquiring how students engage in podcast-based speaking activities and what drives their engagement. It involved 23 EFL students at a public university in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. The data were gleaned from learning portfolios, oral reflections, and students' written narratives in sixteen sessions. The framework of engagement and self-determination theory were employed to carry out thematic analysis. The findings evince that, in general, the students disclosed positive behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement in a series of podcast based-speaking activities. More autonomy and competence-supportive learning environment and unbalanced relatedness-supportive learning environment were found to be the contributing factors of students' engagement. In addition to teachers' and students' factors, parents, families, and students' friends beyond the classroom appeared to be other social factors which might affect students' engagement. This study suggests three recommendations for improving podcast-based speaking classrooms in EFL practices. Some possible research topics for extended investigation are also suggested.},

	abstract = {English, as a language, has become a common way of communication across the globe, resulting in a need for many to read and understand the language. As various countries have opened up to foreigners who seek to do business, study, or live in non-English-speaking countries, the need for having a common language has led to the establishment of English across the world. Over the years, non-native English-speaking countries have developed curriculums for their citizens, especially adults to enable them to teach themselves English. However, the courses have been rather expensive to undertake, leaving the underprivileged looking for alternatives. This paper seeks to look into the issue of accessibility by introducing the benefits of technology in learning English as a Second Language (ESL) and discussing how it has revolutionised teaching in non-native speaking countries. More specifically, this paper will look at Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and its importance towards teaching ESL. Additionally, it will highlight the importance of technology towards teaching students ESL through software and websites, as well as shed light towards some of the negative aspects of technology integration in ESL adult learning.},

The present study aims to examine the types and targets of peer feedback provided by EFL speakers, along with their views and experiences with mobile-assisted peer feedback. A total of thirty-two university students, enrolled in an upper-intermediate to advanced-level rhetoric and oral communication class, used an online platform to anonymously provide feedback on their classmates' oral presentations over a four-week period. Additionally, the participants completed a post-study survey to assess their perspectives and experiences. The findings indicated that the students' feedback predominantly comprised positive remarks than negative critiques. The primary aspects covered by both forms of feedback comprised three major areas: presentation content, spoken performance, and oral presentation skills. Survey results also revealed that, despite expressing concerns about potential friendship bias, anonymity, and issues related to lack of proper attitude in the expression of feedback, EFL speakers generally viewed mobile-based peer feedback positively.},

The paper employed the case study research design in which qualitative data through observation and interview were collected and analysed thematically. The participants involved in the study were 30 first-year undergraduate students in one of the Libyan public universities. The study was conducted in the period of 9 weeks. The course was conducted alternatingly between traditional and PBL lessons. The PBL lessons were based on 7 steps of Schmidt, Dauphinee and Patel (1989). At the end of each PBL lesson, students presented their possible solutions for the problem presented in a form of oral presentation (OP). It was found that after undergoing the HPBL process, the speaking ability of the learners improved in fluency, grammar, comprehension, vocabulary, confidence level, intonation skills and pronunciation. It is, thus, concluded the HPBL approach is a worthwhile alternative for English lecturers for the transformation of the stagnant approach to the teaching of English language in the Libyan EFL context.},

New technology tools are transforming the educational community and how instructors transmit information to students. With this new tool, the flipped classroom technology method is being used on a bigger scale at most academic levels, particularly in Saudi Arabia. This study investigated the flipped classroom method (FCM), i.e., hybrid-flexible and hyflex models based on tri-model teaching approaches, to enhance the speaking skills of EFL students at Applied College for Girls, King Khalid University, at college level, and identify students' opinions and responses towards the strategies used by the instructors. This research answered the following questions significantly: (i) What are EFL students' opinions about their English speaking skills? (ii) To what extent does mixing FCM affect EFL students' speaking skills? (iii) what are the EFL students' opinions about integrating FCM into speaking lessons? A quasi-method was adopted to collect the control (N = 32) and the focused (N = 24) groups' data. Two sets of opinion and satisfactory questionnaires were sent to the students to gain their opinions on learning the speaking skill, including the teacher's observation to perceive the methodology and the instruments used to access speaking during the study. Finally, a focused group interview was conducted to ascertain the students' satisfaction and homogeneous proficiency level in fulfilling the aims of adopting the flipped classroom approach. After one semester (13 weeks) of intervention, the outcomes revealed the significant overview that the students appreciated and found the FCM adequate in being more fluent, confident, and competent in their production classes. The findings might provide other valuable information for researchers involved in EFL advanced pedagogy to explore the operative speaking teaching method and module.},

The review is guided by the following questions: "(1) How is TL implemented across different teaching contexts? (2) What are the identified benefits and challenges in the implementation of TL in TESOL? (3) What are the identified future directions?" Findings indicate that, in ESL contexts, educational equity was more emphasized in the implementation of TL pedagogies, whereas in EFL contexts, the TL pedagogies were more used for instruction reinforcement and creation of class rapport. Furthermore, in K-12 contexts, TL pedagogies were used for disciplining student behavior and promoting equal access to knowledge. In higher education, TL pedagogies empowered students in multilingual written and oral communication. Numerous benefits and challenges of implementing TL, along with future directions for research, were identified in the selected articles. TL pedagogies fostered an inclusive learning environment, increased students 'participation, and facilitated students 'English learning. The identified challenges included logistical issues in the implementation of TL strategies, along with strong adherence to language separation ideologies. For future research, the selected studies propose various topics including the effectiveness of TL pedagogies and call for expansion of research on pedagogical TL.},

	abstract = {Vocabulary knowledge is a prerequisite for mastering any foreign language. It takes a lot of time and effort to develop English as a foreign language (EFL) vocabulary skills. Efficient ways to facilitate this process should be studied and analyzed. The present study aimed to investigate the role of the Discord application in teaching and learning EFL vocabulary. Discord is a free messenger with support for IP telephony and video conferencing, as well as the possibility to create public and private chats for exchanging text and voice messages. The study relied on pre-test and post-test design to get the necessary data of one experimental and one control group, 80 university students altogether. The results of the pre-test showed no significant difference between the two groups. The experimental group was taught with the help of the Discord application, while the control group was dealing with the traditional educational process, that is, 180 min every week in a classroom with a textbook and no electronic educational resources. Results of the t-test indicated that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group on a researcher-made vocabulary post-test. A post-treatment speaking test was administered--the participants took part in speaking interviews where they were asked to give a short speech on one of the topics studied during the experimental training. The representatives of the experimental group managed to use more vocabulary items per person correctly (pronunciation, lexical combinability, etc.). The findings revealed that the suggested way of using the Discord application may positively influence the acquisition of EFL vocabulary and its further application in speaking. Hence, it is recommended that the Discord application be used as a tool in the EFL vocabulary teaching and learning process to reinforce in-class tasks and activities.},

The current study sheds light on the current teaching practices within Academic writing Classes of Full-time online learning in Indonesian Higher Education Context during the pandemics. The aim of the study focuses on (1) the impact of the change in learning process during the pandemics in terms of EFL students' second language acquisition within academic writing environment and (2) lecturers' perception on the shift in the approaches they used to accommodate safety protocols during the pandemics (3) how lecturers cope with the technological changes made to provide a successful SLA input in a hybrid learning setting. This study was carried out through a qualitative approach with a case study design in mind. The study analyzed the current teaching process based on Westhoff's effective second language acquisition which served as the framework of the study. The study employed a qualitative approach using observation and interview as the instrument and analyzed based on Miles \& Huberman's qualitative data analysis technique. The present study found that there were three approaches that the lecturers preferred, they are (1) Hybrid-led second language Acquisition, (2) Synchronous-led second language acquisition, and (3) Asynchronous-led second language acquisition. These approaches were influenced by the lecturers' views which was categorized into three namely; (1) hybrid-led which focuses both on theoretical and practical, (2) theoretical-led which leans solely on writing and reading skills, and (3) practical-led which emphasized on oral output production. The study presents a finding on how Indonesian lecturers current teaching practices during the pandemics within academic writing setting by looking into the teaching performance and how their views shape the learning process for students to learn the target language.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of Flipgrid as a face-to-face speaking activity replacement. The study used four criteria based on asynchronous teaching as well as feedback from student surveys to determine Flipgrid's efficacy as a face-to-face replacement and the use it may serve for future online or hybrid English courses. The use of Flipgrid had some observable positive and negative impacts. Students stated that motivation to learn English, as well as their listening and speaking ability grew over the first semester of the course. However, some student participants remarked that they were apprehensive to show their faces on camera for teachers and peers to see. The lack of real-time feedback from teachers may also be an obstacle to overcome for Flipgrid to be an effective replacement for face-to-face speaking activities.},

	abstract = {A persistent issue exists in Kazakh higher education institutions regarding the nonsystematic approach to teaching grammar. Although some believe that grammar is acquired automatically, thus requiring no separate study, this sentiment may not be entirely accurate. Knowledge may sometimes be presented in an unsystematic manner, lacking structure and clarity. Therefore, students may struggle to comprehend and apply the language's logic effectively. Gamification is suggested as an entertaining and engaging approach to facilitate learning EFL and bridge students' attainments and practice of grammatical subjects. This study investigates a practical solution to that problem by introducing a blended game-based learning project called "Aengime," including board games, cards, and digital games. A qualitative research design was adopted, and the participants comprised three female TEFL teachers and 15 student teachers of science education. The data were collected via literature review, in-class observations, and a focus group interview. The results revealed that game-based activities were communicative in developing students' English skills, and the games positively impacted their self-confidence in speaking English. Also, results showed that incorporating games and playful elements facilitated a positive experience.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate whether students of English as a foreign language (EFL) at the Lebanese University (LU) can effectively improve their language proficiency by creating digital stories. To do so, the researcher introduced digital storytelling (DST) as an optional assignment in an EFL communication course offered at LU in the fall of 2017-2018. Participants were 20 second-year student-teachers majoring in EFL education. After the completion of their individual or group digital storytelling projects, all the 16 videos were uploaded on the researcher's YouTube channel and shared on Facebook and WhatsApp. Participants then answered open-ended survey questions about their experience working on DST. Results show that most participants found the activity enjoyable and educational and were eager to repeat their experience, in spite of the technical difficulties they faced. Many participants also reported having gained more self-confidence and improved their Pronunciation, organizational, technical and research skills, as well as their ability to deliver presentations. The majority of participants found the social aspect of DST highly rewarding and enjoyed sharing their work online with their friends and other English-speakers globally. The positive outcomes of this study suggest that DST should be included in the curriculum of university-EFL communication courses.},

	abstract = {Although a good number of studies have been conducted on the problems EFL learners face to develop oral English communication skills, only a few studies tackled the problems EFL teachers face when teaching oral English communication skills at the tertiary level globally and in the Bangladeshi EFL context. Thus, the objectives of this study are to explore the problems faced by EFL teachers and the relationship between teachers' demographic factors and the problems of teaching oral English communication skills (OECSs) at the tertiary level in Bangladesh. To obtain these objectives, the researchers employed an explanatory sequential mixed-method research design by distributing an adapted survey questionnaire and conducting a semi-structured interview. Data were collected from 46 EFL teachers who were teaching at the department of English at 15 different public and private universities in Bangladesh. The synthesized results from quantitative and qualitative data show that the most frequent problems that EFL teachers face are the use of mother tongue, inappropriate teaching method, learners' passiveness, and lack of motivation, lack of oral practice environment, lack of supporting tools, lack of authentic materials and large class size. Besides, there is no statistically significant relationship between teachers' demographic factors and the problems the teachers face while teaching oral skills at the tertiary level in Bangladesh. In light of the results, this paper recommends that empirical studies should be conducted to provide teachers with methods that would integrate features of the smartphone, such as WhatsApp, call recorder, voice recorder etc. for teaching oral English communication skills.},

The results showed, on the whole, English language learners actually developed some kind of utterances by engaging their own and others. They transformed others' utterances in the oral interaction for their own use in the Asynchronous Computer Mediated Communication (ACMC) environment. Additionally, the learners perceived the voice board activities helpful for the development of their speaking abilities, while the learners' perceptions are mediated through the dialogical activities in which the learners are engaged in.},

	abstract = {The study focuses on the process of assessing (a micro-skill) goal attainment in EFL pronunciation course via measures which can foster different students' attitudes and self-perceptions. Standard (pen-and-paper) tests offer immediate evidence of success but they put heavy demands on students' cognitive, performance and stress-controlling skills. CALL-related techniques can be used as supplementary ones, even if technically assessing different sub-skills, "Kahoot" or "Moodle" quizzes can complement and re-orientate the assessment as well as the learning processes. To investigate the impact of the diverse assessment measures a small-scale research was conducted among Year 1 students of the English Department at the Pedagogical University in Kraków. They are participants in a 90-hours-a-year pronunciation course, where one of the components involves mastering transcribing skills. The specific element of the course evaluated by standard and CALL-related measures in the study were the phonetic variants of the -es and -ed endings in English. Through analysis of test scores, coupled with the ideas obtained via semi-structured interviews, the study hoped to verify the claim that matters such as student comfort, instant individual feedback and personal safety are most efficiently handled by the "Moodle" quizzes. Apart from providing well-balanced scores, they offer the least-threatening, stress-free environments for learning and assessment, thus developing students' self-monitoring their progress.},

	abstract = {Successful oral presentation effectually involves multi-faceted training of listening, writing, and nonverbal delivery besides speaking orally, which calls for a systematic holistic/multimodal approach. However, a multimodal learning environment for fostering EFL learners' presentation development remains virtually unexplored. This study employed multimodal strategies adopted from the VARK model (visual, aural, reading/writing, and kinesthetic/gestural) with the support of digital audio, video, and speech visualization technologies in an English presentation course at a university in Taiwan. Two EFL classes served respectively as the experimental group with a technology-mediated multimodal approach and the control group with a traditional oral approach. Specifically, this research evaluated the experimental participants' oral performance and explored their perceptions of this technology-mediated multimodal approach and its advantages and disadvantages as identified by the participants. Results from independent t-tests showed marginal significant progress of presentation performance in the experimental group. Descriptive statistics from the perception survey and content analysis of students' reflective responses indicated that the participants were overwhelmingly positive about technology-supported multimodal activities implemented in the oral training course but encountered psychological and technological challenges when producing multimodal assignments. Theoretically, the results support the extension of multimodal theory to EFL oral presentation education. Practically, the study informs EFL presentation instructors of the validity of technological-enhanced VARK strategies for learning and teaching EFL presentation. The research results also bear significant implications for the necessity of learner training in technology practices when implementing the pedagogy integrating multimodal technologies into EFL speech education.},

This study explores the technological tools employed by university EFL-speaking teachers during this transition, investigating their continued relevance post-pandemic. With a focus on the experiences of seven university EFL-speaking teachers, this study probes the challenges they encountered, their attitudes toward the challenges, and the technological tools they favored to sustain effective instruction. The participants, chosen using purposive sampling and engaged in online interviews, provided rich insights that were thematically analyzed using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The findings revealed that the teachers' perceptions of Perceived Ease of Use (PEoU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), and the challenges they encountered were pivotal in shaping their attitudes towards the employed technological tools. Several challenges emerged, including students' limited participation, assessing and providing feedback, accessing resources, and the teachers' technology familiarity. Among these complexities, Google Meet and e-learning platforms became preferred tools. The teachers' rationale for these choices encompassed bridging the gaps created by the virtual environment, fostering meaningful tasks, and promoting communication efficiency. Their strategic alignment reflected the teachers' intent to address the challenges encountered during online teaching, and to continue these practices in the post-pandemic.},

After the treatment, participants filled in a TAM-informed survey and participated in semi-structured interviews to measure their perceptions based on the target criteria. Findings indicate positive perceptions of ASR as a writing tool in terms of usefulness (language learning potential) and ease of use (e.g. user-friendly voice commands). We believe that these positive perceptions might lead to an intention to continue to use ASR, suggesting that the technology has L2 pedagogical potential.

Although task-based language teaching (TBLT) and task-supported language teaching (TSLT) have received significant academic attention and recognition in traditional classroom settings, there is insufficient research on their effects on students' L2 motivational self system and speaking self-efficacy in an online emergency EFL classroom. Therefore, this mixed-methods study aims at investigating the impacts of TBLT, TSLT, and PPP on the L2 motivational self system and speaking self-efficacy of students at Hanoi University (HANU). After collecting 117 questionnaires from three English-major speaking courses and performing a group interview with 12 students, the researchers examined the quantitative and qualitative data using one-way ANOVA, sentiment analysis, and content analysis. The findings revealed that task-based instruction was more successful than the PPP approach in increasing student speaking self-efficacy and L2 motivational self system in the online emergency EFL speaking classroom. Moreover, teachers should pay attention to five elements related to the application of PPP, TBLT, and TSLT, including the teacher's role, time allocation, content, group work and peer support, and pre-task/activity preparation, which influence learners' perceived motivation and speaking self-efficacy.},

However, in cases when the learner's pronunciation is expected to be good or native-like, as is expected of language teacher trainees, out-of-class self-study options become prominent. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of online text-to-speech tools used by EFL teacher trainees when preparing for an oral achievement test. The study was conducted with 43 junior year teacher trainees at a large state university in Turkey. A pre- and post-test experimental design was used. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through a questionnaire to explore the trainees' opinions related to pronunciation and their practices to improve this, a post reflection questionnaire for the effectiveness of the procedure, and a speaking rubric to evaluate the oral presentations of the trainees. The results indicate that the trainees perceived a native-like accent as a measure of being a good language teacher. It was also revealed that text-to-speech websites are effective self-study tools in improving trainees' pronunciation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the researcher aims at investigating and revisiting the impact of Krashen's input hypothesis on L2 output. Based on Krashen's theories, the researcher proposes the homogeneity hypothesis as an extension to the input hypothesis. Homogeneity hypothesis states that the linguistic input given to L2 learners should be not only comprehensible but also homogeneous. It also should meet the learners' current rather than next level. Homogeneous input can lead to a well-organized L2 mental lexicon that speeds up the processes of L2 production, acquisition, and perception. Thus, this study attempts to answer the following question: "How homogeneous is the English linguistic repertoire adopted by some EFL learners given a higher level of English than their own?" viz., is the linguistic repertoire of an (i + 1) EFL learners a homogenous American, a homogeneous British, or a hybrid accent? To answer this question and to test the effect of an (i+1) linguistic input ignoring homogeneity, the researcher examines the linguistic input of a sample comprising ninety-two university students who had received a higher heterogeneous level of English during their high school stage before they attended Port Said University. The study concluded that the English accent acquired by the EFL learners was neither British nor American; it was a deformed form of English, which hindered the students' listening and speaking skills from being naturally developed.},

Meanwhile, Byram's (1997) intercultural communicative competence (ICC) model was adopted to explore if students' English proficiency and ICC abilities could enhance or hinder their LMOOCs. Participants of this elective two-credit course, "English Presentation Skills," were all required to complete one LMOOCs course to earn official certificates for the credits. Questionnaires about self-learning background and intercultural communicative competence, weekly reflections on self-learning, assistant-student interviews, and personal presentations at the final stage are conducted to test the consistency between student self-evaluation and class performance. The rubric of the TOEFL iBT Test was adopted to evaluate students' oral expression. Video clips collected in class were analyzed to track the differences in students' target skills. Findings revealed that before integrating LMOOCs in formal education, it is essential for instructors to equip students with enough self-learning skills through orientations and stress time management in MOOCs learning strategies, and scaffold sufficient English communication skills before students are thrown to sink or swim on their won. A revised version of the ICC model was proposed at the end (the context may vary) in the hope of drawing more attention and voice to this research area. The integration of LMOOCs in formal education, be it for language teaching or self-learning, should be directed toward the level of "precision instruction" in the future.},

	abstract = {In universities throughout Japan, English language learners are required to stand in front of their peers and make a presentation with the aid of software such as Microsoft PowerPoint. This type of public speaking activity can often be an anxiety-inducing, glorified reading or memorization exercise of text-heavy slides that fails to meet the intended objective of developing the learners' presentation skills. This paper reports on the perceptions of Japanese university students toward an action research project that utilized poster presentations in conjunction with mobile-video reflective feedback. An activity systems analysis helped uncover the systemic contradictions and tensions that existed in the participants' English as a foreign language (EFL) oral presentation lessons. One hundred and twenty-nine undergraduate economics students from nine classes completed a paper-based survey. In addition, seven students from the same second-year international economics course participated in a focus group interview. The results indicated that most participants viewed mobile-video enhanced self- and peer-reflective feedback as beneficial tools that could help improve the quality of their EFL presentation performances. However, many students expressed concern about public speaking anxiety, the protection of personal privacy, as well as the cultural contrast between Western and Japanese presentation styles.},

It examines the students' opinion regarding English online learning using the different internet or mobile applications. The participants were approximately 80 students from RAK Medical and Health Sciences University located in Ras Al Khaimah in The United Arab Emirates. A closed-ended questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. The results revealed that internet applications have a positive impact on learning English as a foreign language. Students' attitudes towards using internet applications for learning English scored very high in certain areas, while the impact was lower in some other areas that is related to speaking, listening or to group discussions. Based on these results, the researcher suggests that internet applications can be activated at all stages of English language learning and teaching. The implementation of mobile and internet applications is recommended together with the face-to-face learning as a sort of blended learning. It can be budget friendly for universities and at the same time effortless for the students as long as it gives the same impact as face-to-face learning. Therefore, the significance of the study is to try to utilize the best online technological method for teaching and learning English Language that is useful to instructors, institutions as well as students.},

	abstract = {One of the factors that indicate success in English as Second Language (ESL) classrooms is the proficiency of students in oral communication as a foundation for other language skills. The focus of language education in the 21st Century has moved from traditional knowledge of linguistic forms to using language and cultural knowledge as a means to communicate and connect to others around the globe spontaneously and synchronously. Computer-assisted language learning (CALL) is a growing sector and advocacy in the language instruction area that has huge potential for making the learning of a second or foreign language at both the receptive and productive levels easier and more accessible to teachers and students. CALL technology does not supplant teachers, rather teachers become indispensable; their role is no longer that of mere knowledge transmitters but rather approximates that of a guide or inspector of learners' independent learning. However, though most students have high positive attitude towards the use of ICT in learning English, they are still faced with the problem of lack of proficiency in English and lack of training in ICT. The study therefore sought to determine the impact of Rosetta Stone CALL software on university students' proficiency in English language. A pre-test was administered to a group of students before they were exposed to the CALL software in the faculty's language laboratory. The software comprised five audio files with four thematic units each and one visual file; all these exposed participants to a variety of listening, speaking, reading and writing tasks. An observation schedule was used to monitor and investigate the students' progress. After the intervention, a post-test was administered to the group in an attempt to determine differences in their performance by comparing their pre-test and post-test scores. After the posttest, a structured questionnaire was administered on the students to elicit answers to the research questions. Data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistical tools such as frequency count, percentage, and t-tests. Results showed that the students' post-test scores were significantly higher than their pre-test scores. This significant difference between the two scores was an indication of the impact of the Rosetta Stone CALL software on improving students' proficiency in English language. Also, questionnaire responses indicated that a great majority of the participating students found the intervention process motivating and interesting, while observation revealed an increase in the students' level of interaction and participation as they exhibited positive learning attitude towards the software. Based on the findings, recommendations are made on the need to adopt computer-assisted language learning in the teaching and learning of English language in various institutions of learning in Nigeria.},

Consequently, an alternative to the anxiety-arousing activity by using advanced technology for pedagogy is urgent. Prior publications reported the use of virtual reality (VR) for training public speaking and alleviating students' public speaking anxiety (PSA). However, no latest review in this area has been published. This present study employed a systematic review to delineate the trends in the latest decade (between 2011 and 2023), synthesizing research outcomes, methodologies, loci, participants, treatment duration, and research focuses. This systematic review was based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conceptual and theoretical studies were removed, yielding 16 studies with empirical data to be thoroughly examined. Most studies indicated the effectiveness of VR for teaching public speaking and reducing speech apprehension. Several gaps were disclosed, such as the inconsistency of the research findings regarding whether the short duration of VR exposure resulted in the statistically non-significant effects, the unequal distribution of research loci which were mostly reported from the US, the UK, and Europe, and the major focus on English as L1 instead of L2 public speaking training. The results of this review suggest that more pertinent studies in countries with EFL or L2 learning contexts and longer treatment duration be conducted and reported in the globally renowned English-language journals to verify the effectiveness of VR technology in treating PSA.},

	abstract = {Speaking ability is one of the integral language components in English language acquisition. This ability is a challenging one to master for ESL learners, as it involves several linguistic and nonlinguistic features in presenting ideas and it is frequently associated with anxiety. Public speaking anxiety is a common issue faced by students learning a second language. Feelings such as stage fright and nervousness could contribute to their anxiety in communicating using the target language. Additionally, the classroom environment, the presence of the instructor and peer pressure could also be factors which pose a threat for students, particularly in public speaking settings. The present study aims to investigate whether public speaking anxiety can be alleviated through the use of online platforms and/ or video blogs. The creation of personal video blogs could potentially help learners by providing a safe and non-threatening learning environment in which to practise their public speaking skills. This study also aims to identify the factors that influence the use of video blogs as a public speaking platform. A mixed-method approach is designed to examine the effects of using video blogs. A set of questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were applied to groups of tertiary level ESL learners. Quantitative and qualitative approaches to data analysis were carried out and the results indicate that the use of video blogs does bring significant positive outcomes in reducing public speaking anxiety among ESL learners.},

Given the fact that there is a growing call for the development of resilience in teacher education programs, this qualitative study aims at exploring what resources pre-service English language teachers have relied on to overcome challenges and obstacles to learning English as a foreign language. To achieve this aim, data were obtained from 23 pre-service teachers enrolled in English Language Teaching program at a university in Istanbul, Turkey in the form of a reflective writing activity. To triangulate data, a focus group interview was carried out with five of the participating pre-service teachers. Data were analyzed using the thematic analysis approach (Braun \& Clarke, 2006). Findings revealed that pre-service teachers dealt with a variety of obstacles in their English language learning histories such as ineffective methodologies used by teachers, anxiety caused by examinations, obstacles in language skills especially speaking, and language barriers while staying in English-speaking countries. The pre-service teachers mentioned that they demonstrated agency in the process of overcoming these obstacles and their resilience included both personal protective factors and social/environmental protective factors.},

	abstract = {Back-interpreting practice refers to interpreting the translated version of a speech back to its source language. The learning opportunities provided by backinterpreting practice can be explained by Swain's (1985) comprehensible output hypothesis, Laufer and Hulstijn's (2001) involvement load hypothesis, and Schmidt's (1990) noticing hypothesis. In the present study, back-interpreting tasks, blended regularly into the undergraduate EFL classroom for 12 weeks, involved 43 high-intermediate to advanced learners working in pairs and interpreting the Chinese translation of English spoken discourse back into English. They then learned useful expressions from the original English discourse before discussing relevant topics in small groups. Two task types--role plays and chain games--were created to avoid monotony. Qualitative data from focus-group interviews were analyzed to understand 12 lower-level speakers' and 11 higher-level speakers' perceptions of the two task types and of the practice in general. Results showed that the format of role plays primed learners to put themselves in the listeners' shoes by focusing on the gist and avoiding literal interpretation. However, the problem of incomprehensibility still existed for some lower-level speakers, and some higher-level speakers might have slacked off by being vague, failing to exhaust their linguistic resources. On the other hand, chain games engaged learners more because higher concentration, faster responses, and language flexibility were required. The format also facilitated more collaboration and peer-learning. Back-interpreting practice exposed learners' blind spots and enhanced their awareness of native-like expressions. The practice may address the challenges of large class size and heterogeneous oral proficiency levels witnessed in EFL contexts.},

The target sounds were English fricatives, which many of the participants felt were challenging to distinguish and articulate. The training was conducted for five weeks; each week consisted of three HVPT sessions. The training process consisted of an initial explanation of how to articulate the sounds followed by a video that showed the physical articulative movements. The participants listened to stimuli sounds, produced the sounds after each stimulus, and completed an identification task. Based on pre and posttests, the perception performance of the participants improved significantly through the HVPT training. Regarding production, a positive effect was found for one phoneme, while no difference was found for the other. Questionnaire results were generally positive but indicated the need for explicit instruction for some of the fricatives that exhibited relatively lower successful production and perception rates.

However, only a few have integrated language play with classroom tasks, and they just sufficed to the qualitative analyses of the learners' interactions. The present study investigated the possible effect of language play-oriented tasks with planned focus on form on Iranian EFL learners' accuracy in controlled writings. Employing a pretest-posttest design, the participants of the study were introduced to a series of meaningful tasks focusing on particular linguistic features. The tasks were accompanied by language play types such as semantic play, creation of imaginary scenarios, oral narrative play, syntactic play, pragmatic play, linguistic play and verbal dueling during a 12-week adult English class in a private language school. Field notes were taken as well as occasional audio recordings of the instances of tasks and episodes manifesting the given treatment. The findings demonstrated the supremacy of playful tasks over non-playful language learning activities with the items in playful tasks being recalled better. The present study calls for integration of playful language tasks along with planned focus on form in EFL classes and provides EFL teachers with a good set of such tasks to create an enjoying and relaxing atmosphere in their classes.},

	volume = {23},
	url = {https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1055152},
	abstract = {Vocabulary is an area that requires foreign language learners to work independently and continuously both in and out of class. In the Japanese EFL setting, for example, more than 97\% of the population experiences approximately six years of English education at secondary school during which time they are required to learn approximately 3,000 words (i.e., lemmas). Given the lexical distance between Japanese and English, this leaves Japanese university EFL learners with a long way to go before they can acquire a sufficient number of words to comprehend authentic texts in English. To help Japanese university EFL learners sustain their vocabulary learning, the researchers have developed "Lexinote," an e-portfolio system that allows learners to record and save the target words they encounter online, to search for them in online dictionaries, to practice them in several ways including written and oral rehearsals according to word familiarity (i.e., level of understanding of each lexical item), and to share their own output with peers. Learners are guided to monitor and control their vocabulary learning metacognitively according to word familiarity. "Lexinote" also provides learners with multimedia materials such as audio lessons for business and academic vocabulary development and online video lectures to prepare for classes conducted in English. Instructors can monitor students' learning records by number of words recorded, by type of practices chosen, and by how frequently they edit their learning records. This paper introduces the key concepts and basic functions of "Lexinote" and discusses how it can benefit learners, instructors, CALL researchers and developers with results from a survey on learners' perceptions.},

Participants included 123 Korean university students of English. They were divided into two voice-based chat groups: student-student voice-based chat and student-chatterbot voice-based chat. The experiment was administered throughout one semester, 16 weeks. Negotiation of meaning evident in the chats was coded for confirmation check, comprehension check, clarification requests, repetition, and reformulation, and was measured by counting the number of meaning negotiation moves. Important findings were as follows: Firstly, there were significant differences between the first chat and the last chat. The mean frequencies of negotiation moves at all proficiency levels positively changed over time as a result of participating in student-chatterbot voice-based chat. Particulalry, student-chatterbot voice-based chat, as compared to student-student voice-based chat, allowed students to use more negotiation strategies, and the strategies used in the chats also appeared to be different according to the students' proficiency levels. Lastly, positive perceptions of voice-based chat were observed at all proficiency levels. This study provides empirical evidence to substantiate the effects of voice-based chatterbots in oral interaction. Based on the findings, pedagogical implications are made on the effective implementation of voice-based chatterbots in EFL contexts.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in integration of technology for pedagogical purposes. The present study aimed at finding out how presentation in the frame of virtual courses can control embarrassment and shyness of Iranian EFL learners. The practical part concentrated on using Skype for the purpose of presentation in seminar courses. The data collection was based on Revised Cheek and Briggs Shyness Scale (PRSS 14 item) and the target group was selected from three seminar classes during 2016. The final scores of the face to face presentation were compared with presentations via the Skype in such courses. The data were analyzed using a paired sample t-test. The results revealed a significant difference between observed results and expected results. The data were also gathered from semi-structured interviews based on the students' attitudes towards using the Skype to increase the validity of the method. The findings showed that the students had highly positive attitudes towards integration of the technology. This study could impact those students who have enough competence but their personality type prevents them from transferring their knowledge. It could also be fruitful for curriculum developers who want to organize pedagogical area efficiently by overcoming time and place constraints.},

This initiative was developed as a result of a collaboration between a community center and a university. Three 1st-year TESOL master's candidates volunteered to design and teach curriculum to immigrant community members on a weekly basis to meet their needs in ESL and in areas such as health, education, community, housing, leadership, and autonomy. The class consisted of Spanish- and Vietnamese-speaking senior citizens who were community leaders, and who needed the language, skills, and knowledge to be more effective in their leadership roles. A key goal was to create empowerment opportunities for these students to become changemakers and to advocate for themselves, their families, and their communities. In addition to improving their English, student outcomes included finding their voices in their 2nd language through discussions and through oral and written work, developing a sense of unity among class members, and gaining confidence to take action for the common good.},

This study examined the impact of the shadowing technique on enhancing listening comprehension among 30 Chinese EFL senior high school students through two months of targeted instruction. Data were collected through a listening comprehension test, a questionnaire, and student logs. Analyzed test scores using paired-sample t-Tests indicated significant improvements in listening comprehension. Questionnaire results, evaluated through Mean and Standard Deviation, highlighted progress in linguistic skills such as speaking, pronunciation, vocabulary acquisition, and intonation. Log data were examined using qualitative content analysis, revealing cognitive benefits, including enhanced working memory, improved listening focus, reduced anxiety, and increased motivation. Despite these positive outcomes, challenges were encountered, including unfamiliar vocabulary, complex sentence structures, fast speech delivery, and tedium from repetitive exercises. These findings underscore the importance of scaffolding linguistic knowledge, segmenting tasks into manageable stages, and providing structured support to optimize the application of the shadowing technique in language learning.},

	abstract = {Speaking has been stated as being one of the most challenging skills by EFL learners in Turkey. A combination of psychological factors such as anxiety or fear of being criticized and linguistic incompetence has led to this problem. Although initially emerged as a tool to assist learners in listening skills, shadowing technique has also proven to be useful in improving learners' speaking skills as well. The aim of the present study was to see if shadowing technique was efficient enough to help B1 level EFL learners develop positive attitudes towards their speaking skills. Furthermore, the study set out to see if learners get rid of their speaking anxiety and could take active part in communicative activities in the future classes. For this ultimate purpose, a Likert scale consisting of seven questions and interview questions were used. After taking the required permission from the ethics committee, the study was conducted for four weeks, in which participants listened to and repeated the tracks from the podcasts chosen in accordance with their language levels. 31 participants took part in the study. The participants were asked to carefully watch the recordings by paying attention to the pronunciation, stress and intonation. The results from the study were analysed through content analysis and a descriptive research design was used. According to the results, it was observed that the majority of the participants developed positive attitudes towards speaking skills and felt more willing to express themselves in communicative activities. Further studies with more participants are recommended to see if shadowing technique is also applicable in different contexts and groups.},

Whether or not this dichotomy still holds true, in a 21st Century context of teaching and learning, is debatable not least of all because of the exponential development of apps and mobile learning technology. Nevertheless, it is sometimes difficult for educators to know where to begin and for students to know how best to use it to advance their studies and improve their writing. Focusing on university students at a pre-university English as Second Language (ESL) program in Dubai, this paper discusses how mobile learning and the use of a range of apps can foster peer and self-editing, aid noticing and enhance ownership of the writing process. It is argued that flipping corrective feedback helps students to notice their errors and spend more time developing their writing.},

This study investigates what factors most influence instructors to adopt blended learning in different ESL settings. This research is informed by the work of Porter, Graham, Bodily, and Sandberg (2015) in a university context. Utilizing the same frameworks in a mixed methods exploratory research design, I surveyed 48 ESL instructors from three different ESL settings, then followed up with interviews of nine Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) instructors. Quantitative data point to similarities in the factors that most influence the technology-adoption decisions of instructors across different ESL settings, primarily the ability to quickly upload and download materials and the availability of professional development. Qualitative data suggest that adoption is primarily hampered by required time commitments and the lack of technical supports. This research contributes to the discussion on blended learning adoption, specifically in relation to government-funded LINC programs. Lessons learned will facilitate instructor implementation and program policies.},

Borup et al. termed the construct as teacher engagement. Findings revealed that the teacher from the urban school was actively engaged in the interactions. However, the interactions of the sub-urban teacher were limited. The implications of this study suggest that teachers who are seen as digital immigrants need to consider the use of technology.

	abstract = {The purpose of the study is to investigate the types of corrective feedback used by a Thai teacher with adult learners of different proficiency levels in speaking classes in order to facilitate students' language development, as it is an aspect language teachers need to be aware of when teaching speaking. Three different levels of speaking classes were observed, and the audiorecordings were transcribed and analyzed to find out the corrective feedback strategies used based on the model by Lyster and Ranta (1997). The findings reveal that recasts were the corrective feedback strategy most frequently employed by the teacher across all three proficiency levels because it does not interrupt the flow of communication. As recasts and explicit feedback technique are the two most used strategies in correcting students' errors, it can be said that the teacher in the study usually provided input corrective feedback rather than elicit the correct form from the students. The study suggests that language teachers should be aware of making decisions regarding the types of corrective feedback that would be more appropriate to each student's level in the Thai context of English learning, particularly in an adult learner speaking classroom.},

This study examines the effectiveness of podcast assessments as an alternative to traditional written and oral assessments in higher education for forensic science. A mixed-methods approach was used to analyse student perceptions through thematic and Likert-scale feedback on a podcast assessment. Results (n=13) showed that students generally found podcast assessments highly engaging and preferred them over traditional written and oral assessments. Qualitative feedback highlighted deeper engagement, creative expression and a more conversational and flexible format. However, challenges included technical skills, structuring content and the lack of immediate audience feedback. While the majority supported integrating more podcast assessments into future coursework, a minority preferred traditional presentations for their public-speaking benefits. These findings suggest that podcast assessments provide an engaging and student-centred alternative to conventional formats, aligning with contemporary shifts in higher education pedagogy. To maximise their effectiveness, educators should offer structural and technical support while considering hybrid or flexible assessment models. Future research should explore the long-term impact of podcast assessments on learning outcomes across various disciplines.},

"Impact teaching" seeks to develop language education through engagement with audiences beyond the classroom and especially outside higher education. One illustration of this approach is the student projects which have been designed as part of the module 'Contemporary German-speaking film', first introduced at the University of York in 2018/2019. The project brief asks students to organise, prepare, and deliver a film evening event including a film introduction and a post-screening Q\&A in German. The approach has proven very successful with very positive student feedback on the initial in-person format, despite the limited audience numbers. The move to an online format during the pandemic has increased the impact of the event dramatically and the newly collected attendee feedback has confirmed very positive responses to the projects.

Our main goals were to evaluate student perceptions of in-class and out-of-class assignments in hybrid courses, determine what students value most about these modes of learning, and recommend ways to maximize advantages and minimize disadvantages of each. We discovered that students value instant feedback and interacting with their peers when they are in class as in-class assignments were rated significantly higher than out-of-class assignments (p {\textless} 0.05) and higher ratings were significantly associated with responses associated with student-student interaction (p {\textless}0.05). However, the time and place constraints of in-class work limits their ability to formulate their thoughts. Out-of-class assignments were appreciated for their flexibility of pace, time, and place, although students reported time-management problems as well. Like for in-class work, students valued the opportunity of reading their peers' answers as higher assignment ratings for out-of-class assignments were significantly associated with students' ability to read the responses of others. Although participants did not report an effect from specific learning differences, having to write for out-of-class work (as opposed to speaking in class) was reported as a hurdle.

	abstract = {This small-scale study draws on a higher education context where French-speaking students, "in situ" at Bordeaux University, participated in the Sharing Perspectives Foundation's flagship "Erasmus+ Virtual Exchange" (E+VE) program (2018-2019). French-speaking students interacted in English on the topic of "Newcomers and Nationalism" via weekly webinars with non-native English-speaking students from other participating universities in Europe and the Southern Mediterranean region. Authenticity is a complex concept involving the degree of implication and meaning speakers give to their interactions (Gilmore, 2007; Pinner, 2016; Widdowson, 2003). The study therefore addresses the question of how participant feedback can help us to assess E+VE in terms of authenticity. The methods used to investigate this research question were the qualitative analysis of the French students' reflective journals, questionnaires, and interviews. The results show that E+VE is conducive to authentic learner experiences. This study has also enabled a definition of 'authenticity' as a transformative language learner experience in virtual exchange. [For the complete volume, see ED609298.]},

	abstract = {Fears of negative and positive evaluation (i.e., evaluative fears) manifest within performance-based situations (e.g., public speaking, group presentations), particularly among those experiencing social anxiety. Within these performance-based situations, individuals experiencing such evaluative fears frequently display a variety of impairments (e.g., avoidance, nervousness) that might manifest within and across various settings (e.g., employment, school). How do those who experience these fears react to "in-the-moment" feedback about their performance? We constructed the Fear of Evaluation about Performance (FEAP) task to examine ecologically valid experiences with anxiety when reacting to positive and negative feedback. During the task, participants gave a speech, and subsequent to this and in counterbalanced order, received positive and negative feedback about their speech, with continued assessment of anxiety-related arousal throughout the task. We tested the FEAP task among 127 adults, who provided self-reports of fears of positive and negative evaluation before completing the task. Fears of positive evaluation uniquely predicted arousal following receipt of positive feedback, whereas fears of negative evaluation uniquely predicted arousal following receipt of negative feedback. Relative to participants receiving positive feedback first, those receiving negative feedback first experienced elevated post-feedback arousal, followed by a steep decline in arousal post-positive feedback. Conversely, participants receiving positive feedback first experienced a buffer effect whereby arousal post-negative feedback remained low, relative to the arousal experienced post-negative feedback among those who received negative feedback first. We expect the FEAP task to inform basic science on fears of negative and positive evaluation, as well as treatment planning in applied clinical settings.

	abstract = {The use of peer-assisted learning/mentoring (PALM) and translanguaging (TRL) as inclusive learning strategies to support students' transition into Higher Education and enhance their wellbeing in the post-Covid era has not been widely explored. Lecturers express their deep concern about the mental health issues and lack of confidence an increasing number of learners have faced lately in the UK due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of the present study, 80 undergraduate multilingual students were involved in PALM tasks during which they could use their first language through translanguaging and English, the target language, for one academic semester. The main goal was to ensure they had equal opportunities to develop their oral fluency while preparing group presentations. Paired T-tests were used to compare students' pre- to post-tests scores. In terms of this mixed-methods case study, the researcher also analyzed students' reflective reports and the anonymous feedback learners provided thematically to explore their attitudes. Findings indicated that these two approaches enabled students to improve their academic performance significantly although learners felt uneasy at the beginning. The combination of these two methods created a psychologically safe space as learners gradually developed a personal relationship with their peers. In response to the need for more information, as regards the use of PALM activities and TRL with multilingual learners, this study intends to contribute student voice since the inclusion of learner opinion has been minimal. Recommendations for the successful implementation of these two instructional approaches in undergraduate courses and suggestions for further research are provided.},

	abstract = {Classroom assessment practices can be confusing for many teachers. Terminology is numerous and elusive. Different types of assessment serve different purposes. This short discussion paper's contribution originates from my own attempt to determine whether analytic scales would be more appropriate than holistic scales for assessing the L2 writing and speaking of young adults in classroom settings. A scoping search and subsequent review of the relevant literature seems to demonstrate that analytic scales tend to be more precise than holistic scales. If the purpose of the assessment is to provide feedback for learning, analytic scales are more appropriate. Conversely, holistic scales are acceptable if the assessment is not intended to provide implications for improvement. To expand on these general statements, this paper first discusses terminology necessary to understand academic texts on assessment and assessment scales. It then discusses the assessment of writing as performed by teachers, followed by the assessment of speaking performed by both students and teachers, focusing on a small number of studies selected for their relevance and applicability to practice. I hope this paper serves its 'idea sharing' purpose by providing a gentle introduction to the discussion of assessment for teachers with little to no experience in this area.},

	abstract = {Providing effective, high quality feedback that students engage with remains an important issue in higher education today, particularly in the context of academic language support where feedback helps socialise students to academic writing practices. Technology-enhanced feedback, such as audio and video feedback, is becoming more widely used, and as such, it is important to evaluate whether these methods help students engage with the feedback more successfully than conventional methods. While previous research has explored students' perceptions of audio-visual feedback, this paper seeks to fill a gap in the literature by examining the impact of the audio-visual mode on undergraduate students' engagement with feedback compared to written-only feedback. Evidence from an analysis of feedback comments (n = 1040) and corresponding revisions as well as interviews (n = 3) is used to draw conclusions about the value of providing audio-visual feedback to help students revise their writing more successfully. In line with multimedia learning theory (Mayer 2009), it is argued that the multimodal format, conversational tone, verbal explanations and personalised feel of audiovisual feedback allows for a more successful engagement with the feedback, particularly for students with a lower level of English language proficiency.},

Active learning and teaching approaches as well as growing expectations of graduate employability skills have resulted in greater demands on students in UK higher education in terms of their oracy (speaking and listening) skills. Whilst oracy skills have long been the focus of studies in compulsory educational contexts, there is little transfer of research findings to a higher education context. With the aim of opening up the discussion on oracy skills in HE, this paper reports on an exploratory study carried out to investigate how teachers on two undergraduate business modules incorporated oral communication skills in their content, pedagogy and assessment. Data were gathered from observations of lectures and seminars, course documents, and semi-structured interviews with tutors. With reference to an Oracy Skills Framework the paper concludes with suggestions for how oracy skills may be more explicitly embedded into the undergraduate curriculum.},

	abstract = {With the advancement of information and communication technologies, technology-supported peer assessment has been increasingly adopted in education recently. This study systematically reviewed 134 technology-supported peer assessment studies published between 2006 and 2017 using a developed analysis framework based on activity theory. The results found that most peer assessment activities were implemented in social science and higher education in the past 12 years. Acting assignments such as performance, oral presentations, or speaking were the least common type of assignments assessed across the studies reviewed. In addition, most studies conducted peer assessment anonymously and assessors and assessees were randomly assigned. However, most studies implemented only one round of peer assessment and did not provide rewards for assessors. Across studies, it was more often the case that students received unstructured feedback from their peers than structured feedback. Noticeably, collaborative peer assessment did not receive enough attention in the past 12 years. Regarding the peer assessment tools, there were more studies that adopted general learning management systems for peer assessment than studies that used dedicated peer assessment tools. However, most tools used within these studies only provide basic functionalities without scaffolding. Furthermore, the results of cross analysis reveal that there are significant relationships between learning domains and anonymity as well as learning domains and assessment durations. Significant relationships also exist between assignment types and learning domains as well as assignment types and assessment durations.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to illustrate an innovative teaching and learning method developed to address the limitations of 'normal' classroom instruction during the unprecedented health crisis of 2020. The course redesign for the digital classroom discussed in this paper details one instructor's journey of adjusting to a new way of teaching, like most other teachers across the globe, with only a moment's notice. With the help of an on-campus teaching and learning center, discussions with colleagues, and previous knowledge of online learning, the instructor delivered an online learning experience for students that proved more efficient and effective than the previous traditional offline course formats. Specifically, the instructor was able to capitalize on the successes of two redesigned projects for the digital classroom and ultimately develop a redesigned curriculum for a Public Speaking course that replaced the pre-COVID-19 course curriculum. The rewritten projects for the Public Speaking course detailed in this article not only met the course's learning goals but allowed students to thrive in a virtual-only environment carefully created to invite engagement and participation at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being pandemic-driven, this revised class format and accompanying lessons learned for the digital classroom have been adopted across all the instructor's classes. The course updates are a superior method of engaging students and motivating them to prepare more, as evidenced by student feedback and assessments.},

	url = {https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED601145},
	abstract = {Recent trends in higher education have initiated an increase in the attention given to the quality of teaching offered to the students, and significant changes in student populations since 2000, such as increasing social diversity (Biggs \& Tang, 2011), have required educators to relook at their teaching and instructional practices. As diversity in higher education increases and accelerating technology adoption impacts on teaching, improving the quality of the instructive-educational process becomes fundamental based on understanding, observing, and re-evaluating the differences amongst our students. At the higher education level, our students are even more diverse than K-12 students due to their academic experiences and professional interests. Our learners differ not only culturally or linguistically, but also in their cognitive abilities, learning preferences, background knowledge, and have various levels of strengths and weaknesses in the area of multiple intelligences; hence a rethinking of the structure and management of the classroom, modifying curricula and maximizing classroom interactions are necessary. Differentiated activities together with Web 2.0 tools and mobile-assisted language learning applications can enhance collaborative learning where learners actively participate in groups to explore a topic or discuss to finalize a project. Differentiation or academically responsive instruction concentrates on teaching strategies that provide students with multiple pathways in the teaching and learning process to meet their needs. Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) is a subarea of mobile learning in which integration of new mobile technologies into teaching and language learning has been a primary focus, and numerous mobile applications and online Web 2.0 tools have been developed to support academic English language learning, including reading, listening, writing, speaking, functional grammar and vocabulary. Web 2.0 refers to a huge array of web-based tools such as blogs, wikis, folksonomies, social networking sites and content-sharing sites which can offer numerous instructional opportunities like active engagement, personalized learning and innovation, and can empower and enable learners to participate in a variety of ways. This qualitative study explored the integration of MALL applications and Web 2.0 tools in differentiated EAP classes and sought to understand how they can assist in improving collaboration of EAP students to achieve higher levels of cognitive learning in higher education in UAE. The findings suggest that the usage of MALL apps and Web 2.0 tools in differentiated EAP classes in higher education assist students in terms of feedback, motivation, collaboration, pace, multi-modality and research skills; gives them an opportunity to choose the activity and the type of assessment that corresponds to their needs and abilities.

In the stage of classroom observation, the potential responsivities relating with anxiety were explored through the analysis of fieldwork notes; the questionnaires were filled out by the students after they finished their presentations to unveil the students' perceptions of their anxiety and the causes for such anxiety; the semi-structured interview was carried out to provide further evidence for the above findings. The research participants were twenty two students majoring in English education in a Korean national university. The research findings indicated that Korean students suffered different degree of anxiety in the course of classroom presentations; the major responsivities to anxiety included repeatedly occurring subconscious behaviors, silence, speech disruptions and slow rate of speaking and so forth. Concerning the causes arousing anxiety in classroom presentations, there were four major sources, consisting of negative attitude towards classroom presentations, preparation time, language proficiency, negative feedback from peers, while other factors like making mistakes, attention from audience, and teachers' feedback were not the major source for students' anxiety. These research findings should shed new light on classroom teaching for language teachers to improve their curriculum design to relieve students' anxiety in classroom presentations.},

	abstract = {Since a humanoid robot does not get tired regardless of how many mistakes a student makes, and because it can be equipped with novel teaching techniques and updated with the most current knowledge, it can be useful for achieving many educational goals. The rationale behind this is that it has been shown in the literature that robots are more useful as teaching aids than computers or other instructional tools, as they can mimic human responses. Furthermore, humans, especially children, prefer robot interaction to other interaction types. Adults generally struggle to learn a foreign language, but this is true of some students, too. With their multilingual interaction capabilities, their ability to provide real-time feedback, and their humanlike physical shape, some types of humanoid robots can be of great assistance to students in learning a foreign language. The use of humanoid robots leads to a personal connection with the students, and this can help overcome issues related to shyness, reluctance, frustration and lack of confidence that may emerge in dealing with a human teacher. Moreover, as humanoid robots can be programmed to know specifically what each individual student needs to learn, they can be quite useful for one-on-one speaking activities. Considering the many possibilities that can be offered by information and communication technology tools, particularly by humanoid robots, this paper reviews the roles and functions of humanoid robots in teaching a foreign language, presents novel approaches in this domain, provides research challenges, and finally outlines future research directions.},

	abstract = {Schools that build and support high levels of trust between stakeholder groups have been shown to support greater collaboration amongst those groups, including parents, teachers, administrators, and students (Tschannen-Moran, 2001). When stakeholders in schools feel the sense of psychological safety that accompanies trust, they are more willing or likely to engage in the behaviors that support continuous improvement, including speaking up about concerns or mistakes, seeking help or feedback from one another, innovating, and engaging in relational bridge-building across traditional institutional boundaries (Cosner, 2009). In addition to fostering collaborative behaviors, trust has been found to be related to a host of other positive organizational outcomes, such as the establishment of more just organizational structures in schools (Hoy and Tarter, 2004), greater organizational attachment by teachers (Bryk and Schneider, 2002), and healthier school climates (Tschannen-Moran and Gareis, 2015). Rarely, however, has trust between youth and adults been studied to understand how it might contribute to their successful collaboration and accomplishment of organizational goals or objectives (aside from student learning itself). This tendency is likely due to a strong institutional bias towards positioning students as the passive recipients of organizational reform efforts, rather than as active participants or collaborators in designing reforms to better serve their needs (Bragg, 2007; Cook-Sather, 2002; Fielding, 2001). This study seeks to identify the factors that led to trust formation between youth and adult teams engaged in one such initiative: a collaborative peer review project which engaged administrators, teachers and students in a quality review process developed as an alternative to the typical pathway to accreditation. Three schools participated in this alternative program in which joint teams of administrators, teachers, and high-school aged youth from each school used a variation on the practice of instructional rounds to gather information for continuous improvement efforts. The central research questions were: How was trust established between youth and adults working within collaborative peer review teams? What practices, beliefs and processes did participants perceive supported or undermined the formation of trust within these teams?},

This study was intended to examine the usefulness of a "pre-lecture medical terminology guide" in improving those students' academic achievement and class participation during their study of a physiotherapy course. A two-cycle approach of intervention was followed implementing a written pre-lecture guide in the first cycle, and a written pre-lecture guide with a 5-minute explanatory lecture in the second cycle. The obtained results showed a slight improvement in students' scoring in the first cycle, but a significant one during the second cycle. In addition, the findings revealed students' preference of pre-lecture medical terminology guide with a 5-minute explanatory lecture as an effective teaching method for them to understand the medical terms in English. The students also showed a positive feedback towards the pre-lecture guide and felt it helped them understand and memorize difficult medical vocabulary more easily. They also believed that the same technique should be used with other physiotherapy classes.},

As academics spend extensive time and effort on the production of summative feedback, this paper draws on the initial findings from a small-scale study of the use of "Pecha Kucha" as a methodology for formative assessment within two undergraduate modules. The dominant themes suggest some disparity between staff and students regarding the "purpose" of formative assessment and the paper argues that "Pecha Kucha" can be used as a platform to develop assessment dialogues, with the subsequent development of a pedagogic literacy around feedback practices. Furthermore, the value of listening to different narratives from research studies, students and tutors supports the reframing of assessment as a supportive mechanism beyond the elicitation of "proof" of learning.},

This study investigated the differences between Iranian English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers and learners regarding their perspectives towards the timeline of error correction in the speaking skill. Two main categories of immediate and delayed feedback types were determined, with the immediate category specifically referring to "very soon" and "after speaking" and the delayed one relating to "after activities" and "end of class" sub-categories. To empirically test the hypothesis behind the study, a total of 460 teachers and learners were invited to complete Fukuda's questionnaire. The data obtained were analysed through multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), the results of which showed teachers' preferences for immediate correction while the learners' inclined towards delayed correction. Based on these results, specific properties and circumstances in relation to the timing of feedback are proposed to enhance its efficiency in language classrooms.},

	abstract = {Only a few applications to teach Turkish as a foreign language through remote or distance learning platforms have been developed in recent years in Turkey. Distance Turkish Learning Portal (DTLP), developed by Yunus Emre Institute to teach Turkish remotely, is one of these applications. An unexpected interest in this practice was observed after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the portal is still in the trial phase. For this reason, although user feedback is vital in order to improve the portal, no academic research on this issue has been conducted yet. In this context, the researcher aims to evaluate the Distance Turkish Learning Portal as regards students' opinions. For this purpose, a qualitative research model, which is frequently used in educational sciences, was used to collect data, and a subsequent case study was carried out for an in-depth evaluation of their beliefs. The methods were employed to effectively and reliably collect data on learners' beliefs on the issue in question. Data was collected through a Google form that was shared with the participants. As a result of the research, it is understood that the participants enjoyed using the portal in that, firstly, it is free; secondly, it provides the opportunity to get to know Turkish culture, and finally, it also supports autonomous and self-learning. On the other hand, the technical infrastructure of the portal is insufficient, and there is no instructional or tutorial support, lack of interactive speaking features, besides the number of videos have been found to be inadequate by the users. At the end of the study, based on the findings, some suggestions were offered by the researchers to improve the Distance Turkish Learning Portal.},

In addition to having updated academic content, it now has a specific focus on employability skills and their transferability to the real world. In particular, this paper evaluates the assessment practice on this unit in terms of the embedding of employability into the three assessed elements which consist of a Reading Test, a Speaking Test and an online Portfolio. Student feedback so far has been very positive, highlighting the usefulness of the unit, not just for academic study whilst at university, but for the world of work.},

	url = {https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED603224},
	abstract = {The article reveals the issue of the conditions for the effective use of multimedia educational presentations for teaching a foreign language in a non-linguistic institution. Particular attention is paid to the analyzed and summarized basic requirements for the development and design of modern multimedia educational presentations in the domestic and foreign higher education system. The article also examines the issues of evaluating multimedia educational presentations, namely the evaluation of a multimedia educational presentation from the perspective of students presenting the educational presentation; from the position of the teacher, who evaluates the educational presentation and from the position of students listening to the presentation. The article emphasizes the effectiveness of the use of interactive learning technologies with the aim of forming the universal competencies that they need in the future for personal and professional communication. The essence and content of the evaluation headings is revealed, helping to make certain expectations of students and teachers, since the evaluation criteria for a multimedia presentation are developed in advance and presented to students, allowing to form a focused feedback from the teacher. In conclusion, the conclusion is made that the use of multimedia presentations during the teaching of a foreign language in a non-linguistic institution is a tool that contributes to the expansion of the possibilities for independent work of students and the formation of self-esteem in students. Multimedia educational technologies become not only the main teaching and methodological material for organizing independent work of students of a non-linguistic high school, but also the main means of informational support for public speaking students, stimulating students to learn a foreign language. It is established that the certain principles of constructing a multimedia educational presentation, such as the high quality of teaching material in a strict academic style, and the development of a clear algorithm of the report; high quality of artistic design of the educational material; technical design and previous information retrieval of educational information using interactive technology and the Internet as a whole will contribute to the self-organization and self-development of the student, in particular, to the expansion of his scientific horizon.

	abstract = {In spite of Krashen's (1985) claims that the only way to acquire a second language is through non-stressful comprehensible input, Swain (1995, 1998, 2005) and others propose that the production of language (speaking or writing), under certain circumstances, is a significant part of the second-language acquisition process. Swain also states that there are three functions of output, and one of these is the noticing or triggering function, in which through producing output, learners become aware of their linguistic knowledge. This study examines the role and effectiveness of output--in particular, the noticing function of language output--in developing the writing skills of an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) student from Saudi Arabia. The notice function enables the student to identify lexis and grammar problems in his writing. Data collection for the study was conducted in three stages: In Stage 1 the participant, who studies English at Latrobe Language Centre in Level 4A, wrote three paragraphs in response to illustrated questions. In Stage 2, the participant compared his original writing to model paragraph feedback tools. In Stage 3, the student rewrote his original paragraphs based on what he noticed in Stages 1 and 2. This methodology demonstrated the aspects of language that a second-language learner noticed while forming a paragraph on his own. It also illustrated what the participant noticed when he compared his writing to a model and what changes he made to his writing, as a result. It pushed the learner to create a modified output, leading to development of his writing skills in second-language acquisition.},

Data analysis employed Grounded theory (Strauss \& Corbin, 1999) for qualitative data, and means and S.D for quantitative ones. Findings from the peer interview task revealed five aspects of students' English speaking although they were able to successfully communicate in their interview conversation. Also, the results from the questionnaire showed that the students perceived the benefits of the CEFR-TBL Innovative Program and that the program enhanced them in using English in both verbal and non-verbal communication.},

The participants were 4,220 English language teachers in Thailand. An online questionnaire was randomly distributed via e-mails, a website, personal contacts, and Line groups. The four Likert-scale questionnaires asked the participants to complete five main parts, including 1) demographic information, 2) knowledge and skills development needs, 3) pedagogical development needs, 4) technological development needs, and 5) needs for involvement in future Thailand TESOL's activities. The questionnaire data were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed using mean, standard deviations, percentages, and content analysis. The results showed that the teachers mostly needed to develop speaking, listening, pronunciation, and cross-cultural communication. Grammar and vocabulary were areas that needed to be improved the least. The teachers also needed to develop many pedagogical skills, e.g., creative material development, teaching speaking, game-based learning approach, 21st-century teaching management, teaching listening, and CEFR-based teaching. For technological development, most teachers needed to understand the technology-based/blended learning approaches and practice their technology and online material development skills. The study also revealed aspects of professional development, including preferred training designs, types, time duration, and channels. The results are helpful for policymakers, course designers, training organizations, and, of course, Thailand TESOL to provide appropriate assistance to meet the teachers' needs and improve the English teaching situation in Thailand.},

	abstract = {This study develops a model of analytic rating scales to assess L2 Chinese oral performance. It uses Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify a model and employs Confirmative Factor Analysis (CFA) in a separate dataset to test the degree of model fit. The researcher videotaped ten speeches and ACTFL professional raters assessed the oral performances in these samples. The researcher then selected three samples (Samples 1, 2, and 3) to represent the proficiency levels of Novice High, Intermediate High, and Advanced Low. Then, the researcher developed 20 rating items by interviewing ten experienced L2 Chinese teachers and running an EFA. The 20 items were descriptors that Chinese teachers used to assess oral performance in two studies: Study 1 and Study 2. To complete Study 1, the researcher recruited 45 teachers to assess Sample 1 using the 20 items, 62 teachers rated Sample 2, and 49 teachers rated Sample 3. In Study 2, 104 teachers assessed all three samples. The EFA indicated a four-factor model of analytic rating scales: "fluency," "conceptual understanding," "communication clarity," and "communication appropriateness." In this model, the correlations between these analytic rating scales were relatively high and teachers weighted "fluency" as most important. Together the four scales explained 65.5\% of teachers' holistic judgments of oral performance. The CFA did not show a strong model fit to the data, but the fit was acceptable. This model advances our understanding of the relationship between analytic rating scales and holistic ratings in the context of L2 Chinese. These findings give Chinese teachers with which a reference to assess U.S. college students' L2 Chinese oral performance.},

We consider the role of transfer and simplification in acquiring mental representations of the L2 grammar, specifically in the area of tense and aspect, and how learners deal with integrating grammatically encoded, lexical and discursive information, including mismatching feature combinations leading to particular inferential effects on interpretation. Data is presented on the Spanish past tenses (simple and compound past, pluperfect, imperfect and progressive forms) from two tasks, an oral production film retell and a multiple-choice interpretation task, completed by learners at A2, B1, B2 and C1 CEFR levels (N = 20-24 per level). L1 influence is progressively attenuated as proficiency increases. Difficulties were not always due to negative L1 transfer, but related also to grammar-discourse interface issues when integrating linguistic and pragmatic information in the interpretation process. This has clear implications for the teaching of closely related languages: instruction should not only focus on crosslinguistic contrasts, but also prioritize uses requiring complex interface integration, which are harder to process.},

	url = {https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED572033},
	abstract = {This paper evaluates the contribution of instructional technology to advanced-level foreign/second language learning (AL2) over the past thirty years. It is shown that the most salient feature of AL2 practice and associated Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) research are their rarity and restricted nature. Based on an analysis of four leading CALL journals ("CALICO," "CALL," "LL\&T," "ReCALL"), less than 3\% of all CALL publications deal with AL2. Moreover, within this body of research, the range of languages involved is very restricted. Three languages, English, German and French, account for nearly 87\% of the studies. Likewise, in nearly 81\% of the cases, the learning focus is on the written language. Attention to oral-aural skills accounts for only 18\% of all AL2 CALL projects. Whatever the targeted language or linguistic focus, the most striking aspect of advanced-level L2 CALL studies is the lack of information given regarding the competency level of students and the linguistic level of the activities undertaken. The determination of these critical parameters is thus of necessity very much a highly interpretive process. Based on the available evidence, it is estimated that half of the learners in these AL2 studies were in fact within the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) B1 range, i.e. below what would generally be considered as advanced-level competency. So, too, half of the assigned tasks were deemed to have been below the B2 level, with 40\% of these below the B1 level. This study concludes that both quantitatively and qualitatively the contribution of instructional technology to advanced-level L2 acquisition has been very limited.

	abstract = {Considering the critical role of working memory (WM) in age-related cognitive decline, WM interventions are proposed as an effective approach for promoting healthy aging. However, traditional WM interventions often yield limited results, possibly due to a lack of interest and challenge. In light of the recent prominent trend of gamification, this study developed a challenging gamified WM intervention aimed at improving WM and providing extensive cognitive benefits for older adults, along with entertainment. Seventy-six older adults were randomly assigned to either the WM intervention group or the active control group. All participants underwent twelve 1-hr training sessions spanning 6 weeks. For each participant, cognitive assessments were completed at pretest, posttest, and 6 months after the intervention while structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI scans were conducted before and after intervention. The results revealed significant improvements in WM, inhibitory control, visuospatial processing, and episodic memory among older adults following the intervention. The left frontal pole, located in the rostral prefrontal cortex (rPFC), exhibited increased cortical thickness accompanied by reduced functional homogeneity and weakened connectivity with the left inferior temporal gyrus. Further statistical learning analysis demonstrated a consistent relationship between the changes at the left frontal pole and improved WM performance, suggesting that the rPFC may support WM and play a protective role in brain aging. The findings highlight the broad benefits of the gamified WM intervention on neurocognitive plasticity in the rPFC of older adults, indicating its potential as a promising tool for mitigating neurocognitive decline during the aging process.

	abstract = {One of the largest challenges in intensive longitudinal monitoring studies (e.g., ecological momentary assessment [EMA]) that include repeated assessments of constructs of interest is getting participants to complete the surveys they are sent. The goal of this study was to test a simple gamification method called “The Emoji Game” that was designed to increase adherence with EMA surveys (i.e., compliance or completing more surveys). The game involved embedding an emoji (i.e., a pictogram) randomly into one of the survey questions, where both the emoji and question where the emoji was hidden changed every few days. Participants who found the emoji were given an entry into a raffle to win a bonus gift card. Participants were 85 adolescents, who were recently admitted to acute psychiatric care due to suicidal thoughts or behaviors, and administered an EMA protocol for 4 weeks after discharge. This study covered three time periods: the 4 months that we ran the Emoji Game (n = 31), the 4 months immediately before the Emoji Game (n = 22), and the same period as the Emoji Game 1 year prior (n = 32). We found that participants in the “Emoji Game” period completed significantly more surveys (M compliance = 63.07\%) than either comparison group (40.47\% and 43.98\% for 4 months and 1 year prior, respectively). We found no differences among groups on survey engagement (e.g., number of zeros per survey, a metric of careless and quick responding). Taken together, this suggests that the Emoji Game is an easy, low-burden way to gamify EMA studies that increases compliance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

Across 12 field and lab studies, we explore when, why, and for whom the information load carried in TED talks causes them to gain (vs. lose) popularity. First and foremost, we uncover a negative effect whereby increases in the number of topics broached in a talk (i.e., information load) hurt viewer adoption. The cause? Processing disfluency. As information load soars, content becomes more difficult to process, which in turn reduces interest. Probing process further, we show this effect fades among audience members with greater need for cognition, a personality trait marking a penchant for deep and broad information processing. Similarly, the effect fades among edutainment viewers favoring education goals (i.e., cognitive enrichment) whereas it amplifies among those favoring entertainment (i.e., hedonic pleasure). Our investigation also documents the counterintuitiveness of our findings (i.e., how individuals mispredict which talks they would actually [dis]like). From these results, we derive theoretical insights for processing fluency research and the psychology of cultural products adoption (i.e., we weigh in on when, why, and for whom fluency has favorable vs. unfavorable downstream effects). We also derive prescriptive insights for (a) players of the edutainment industry whose very business hinges on curating appealing content (e.g., TED, Talks@Google, The Moth, Big Think, Spotify) and (b) communicators of all creeds wishing to broaden their reach and appeal (e.g., professors, scientists, politicians, journalists, bloggers, podcasters, content editors, online community managers).

	abstract = {Gamification is a promising approach to reducing misinformation susceptibility. Previous research has found that “inoculation” games such as Bad News and Harmony Square help build cognitive resistance against misinformation. However, recent research has offered two important nuances: a potentially inadvertent impact of such games on people’s evaluation of non-misinformation (“real news”) and exponential decay over time if no memory-strengthening exercise is provided. We address these issues in two preregistered lab experiments (N1 = 191, N2 = 321) and four quasi-experimental in-game surveys implemented in Harmony Square (N3 = 559) and Bad News (N4 = 2,558, N5 = 419, N6 = 882). In Experiments 1 and 2, we test if providing different types of feedback after playing Bad News enhances discriminative ability of misinformation and real news 1 week postgameplay and find that doing so resulted in homogeneously better accuracy at identifying both misinformation and non-misinformation compared with a control condition, which played Bad News without feedback. In Experiments 3–6, we implemented two different types of feedback exercises in the Harmony Square and Bad News games and find that this significantly boosts discernment compared with playing the game without a feedback exercise, primarily by improving accuracy at detecting real news. We confirm these results using signal detection theory. We conclude that feedback exercises boost the effectiveness of gamified misinformation interventions, likely due to an improved learning environment.

	abstract = {Gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve the detection of online misinformation are becoming increasingly prevalent. Two of the most notable interventions of this kind are Bad News and Go Viral!. To assess their efficacy, prior research has typically used pre–post designs in which participants rated the reliability or manipulativeness of true and fake news items before and after playing these games, while most of the time also including a control group who played an irrelevant game (Tetris) or did nothing at all. Mean ratings were then compared between pre-tests and post-tests and/or between the control and experimental conditions. Critically, these prior studies have not separated response bias effects (overall tendency to respond “true” or “fake”) from discrimination (ability to distinguish between true and fake news, commonly dubbed discernment). We reanalyzed the results from five prior studies using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, a method common to signal detection theory that allows for discrimination to be measured free from response bias. Across the studies, when comparable true and fake news items were used, Bad News and Go Viral! did not improve discrimination, but rather elicited more “false” responses to all news items (more conservative responding). These novel findings suggest that the current gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve fake news detection are not as effective as previously thought and may even be counterproductive. They also demonstrate the usefulness of ROC analysis, a largely unexploited method in this setting, for assessing the effectiveness of any intervention designed to improve fake news detection.

	abstract = {Contingency management is an effective treatment for cigarette smoking cessation but feasibility and acceptability concerns have been barriers to implementation. We conducted a pilot test of QuitBet, a commercial, digital (smartphone) social game for smoking cessation during which participants earned financial incentives for abstinence. QuitBet included a social feed for posting messages and entirely participant-funded incentives in the form of a deposit contract (the “bet”). QuitBet had a bet of \$30 and lasted for 28 days. After a week to prepare for quitting, the quit day was Day 8. Between Day 9–28 (a 20-day period), participants earned back \$1 of their \$30 bet for each day of carbon monoxide (CO)-verified abstinence (≤ 6 ppm). Remaining bet money was pooled into a “grand prize” pot. Participants who were abstinent on at least 19 of the 20 days (1 “lapse” day allowed) were declared “winners” and split the grand prize pot equally. A game host posted a daily message containing evidence-based education about smoking cessation or a discussion topic. Recruitment goals were met. Among the players (N = 50 U.S. adults, 78\% female), 17 (34\%) were winners. Thirty-seven participants (74\%) responded to a post-QuitBet survey, of whom 95\% said they would be interested in playing another QuitBet and would recommend QuitBet to others. Overall, feedback was positive with some suggestions for improvement. In conclusion, a digital social game for smoking cessation with a deposit contract was feasible and acceptable. Next steps include conducting a randomized trial to establish efficacy and a sustainable business model. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)},

To address this problem, we provide a comprehensive theoretical integration of multiple literature streams where research has explored work–leisure blending. Further, we develop a tripartite dimensional framework designed to elucidate the central dimensions of work–leisure blending (i.e., segmentation–integration, unstructured–structured, and independent–interactive) undergirding this phenomenon. Using this framework as a theoretical foundation, we then discuss important contextual considerations and future research directions related to work–leisure blending.

The aim of these studies were to (a) test how often people tend to engage with the app in a “real-world” setting, and (b) test whether an app with gamification features and evaluative conditioning strategies change automatic evaluations of exercise versus sedentary behavior. Participants (N = 289, 238 female, M age = 33) were randomly allocated to have access to either Flex Exercise—a game-based app which contained 70\% exercise-related content or Flex Control—the same game-based app with no exercise content. Participants completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) as assessments of automatic evaluations immediately after exposure to Flex and 24 hr later. No significant between-group difference was observed immediately after exposure to Flex for automatic evaluations; however, 1 day following exposure, those in the Flex Exercise condition had significantly more favorable automatic evaluations of exercise than those in the Flex Control condition (d = 0.24). This effect was driven by a change in automatic evaluations, as assessed through the IAT, in the control condition more favorable toward sedentary behavior relative to physical activity and was magnified by user engagement. This mHealth intervention may have inadvertently enhanced sedentary automatic evaluations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

To examine this, an experiment was conducted with 215 participants using an image annotation task that implicitly addressed the issue of water conservation. The findings indicate that control-oriented people may have internalized the external goal of conserving water when presented with reward badges compared with informational badges.

	abstract = {“Gamblification” is a rapidly emerging form of media convergence between the more chance-based activity of gambling and the more skill-based activity of (video) gaming, for example in the competitive video gaming known as esports. The marriage of video gaming and gambling has been theorized as bringing about new forms of gambling-related cognitive processes in individuals and affecting the ways in which they approach and evaluate gambling situations. As such, a pertinent research problem is whether existing measurement instruments designed to identify gambling related cognitions can be employed in this new context and population, and if not, how they can be adapted. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the psychometric properties of Gambling Related Cognitions Scale (GRCS) and a series of items developed following a review of existing literature. We employ 3 separate data sets gathered from video game players who also gamble (N = 442; 391; and 335). The results indicate that the GRCS is not a robust measure to use for video game players who gamble; the new GamCog measure was, therefore, developed to address this gap. The study implies that the most significant cognitive differences between video game players and the wider population are the ways in which concepts of skill and luck are perceived, potentially due to the sense of personal agency engendered by video games.

In two studies, we demonstrate that Honesty-Humility can be inferred with at least modest validity from virtual behavior cues. In a third study, we tested the fakeability of the virtual cues. This study found that even under faking instructions the virtual cues were related to Honesty-Humility, however, the virtual cues were just as fakeable as self-reported Honesty-Humility. Our results imply that virtual cues can be incorporated in serious games to measure personality. Future research may investigate whether the identified virtual cues are able to predict important Honesty-Humility related outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)},

There is a growing need for flexible provision of home-based psychological services to increase reach even for traditionally underserved chronic illness sufferer populations. Digital interventions can fulfill this role and provide a range of psychological services to improve functioning. Despite the potential of digital interventions, concerns remain regarding users’ engagement, as low engagement is associated with low adherence rates, high attrition, and suboptimal exposure to the intervention. Human–computer interaction (e.g., theoretical models of persuasive system design, gamification, tailoring, and supportive accountability) and user characteristics (e.g., gender, age, computer literacy) are the main identified culprits contributing to engagement and adherence difficulties. To date, there have not been any clear and concise recommendations for improved utilization and engagement in digital interventions. This paper provides an overview of user engagement factors and proposes research informed recommendations for engagement and adherence planning in digital intervention development. The recommendations were derived from the literature and consensualized by expert members of the European Federation of Psychology Associations, Psychology and Health Standing Committee, and e-Health Task Force. These recommendations serve as a starting point for researchers and clinicians interested in the digitalized health field and promote effective planning for engagement when developing digital interventions with the potential to maximize adherence and optimal exposure in the treatment of chronic health conditions.

Method: Participants reporting elevated levels of body dissatisfaction were randomly allocated to an app-based intervention (n = 26) or to a wait list group (n = 27). The app-based intervention included a brief counseling session and 14 days of training with the Mindtastic Body Dissatisfaction app (MT-BD). The MT-BD app uses gamification strategies to systematically foster approach of functional and avoidance of dysfunctional stimuli. The primary outcome was body dissatisfaction as assessed with the Body Dissatisfaction scale of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (Garner, 1991). Secondary outcome measures included severity of eating disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms. Results: Participants in the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in body dissatisfaction compared to the wait list group (d = −0.62). The intervention group also showed greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms compared to the wait list group (d = −0.46). Reductions in body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms were sustained at a 1-month follow-up.

Although qualitative research has described how elite endurance athletes implement recovery through self-regulatory processes, there is a need to explore how this evidence transfers to more ecologically valid contexts. This study employed experience sampling methods to describe how elite endurance athletes self-regulated their recovery around two important workouts, 2–3 days apart in their planned training. Twenty-two endurance athletes (seven males, 15 females) training within Canadian national cycling and triathlon teams (able-bodied and parasport) reported on processes of recovery self-regulation and perceived recovery and stress states using their smartphones, up to eight times daily for 5 days. We described indices and patterns for how the athletes employed four recovery self-regulation processes (i.e., awareness, checking-in, interpreting, adjusting), as well as when in relation to their key workouts and recovery-stress states. The specific self-regulatory processes were strongly correlated but differed in frequency, intensity, consistency, and predictors of use, which suggests that the processes represent synergistic yet unique competencies. Greater use of recovery self-regulation processes was associated with states of higher perceived stress and, to a lesser extent, lower perceived recovery. Although the time remaining to a workout and elapsed after a workout were each associated with perceived stress and recovery states, these timelines were not associated with any self-regulation process. Our findings indicate that elite athletes may be frequently engaged in dynamically self-regulating their recovery between important training sessions.

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) can serve as a key indicator of emotion regulation; however, few studies have examined psychophysiological stress reactions within a couple’s context. Method: Forty-three couples (N = 86 individuals) with a trauma history were assessed for PTSS and RSA at baseline. One partner then completed a stressor task using a film-clip depicting sexual assault. Afterward, the couple was reunited and completed a dyadic discussion task where both partners’ RSA was continuously measured while they discussed the stressed partner’s thoughts and feelings about the stressful film-clip. Results: Moderated repeated measures actor–partner interdependence models were conducted, examining the self and coregulation of RSA and moderation of such regulation by PTSS. There was significant self-regulation from both partners, and a coregulation process whereby the nonstressed partner’s RSA influenced the rate of change in RSA of their stressed partner. Additionally, greater PTSS in the nonstressed partner was associated with a weakening of both self and coregulation. Conclusion: Patterns of both self- and coregulation, within and between romantic partners emerged and illustrate the impact of PTSS within these dyadic physiologic processes. Findings have theoretical and clinical implications in physiological dyadic interactions and potential stress recovery, particularly emphasizing the relevance of examining biomarkers such as RSA among partners with a trauma history during recovery from stress.

	abstract = {The conscience, which can be described as an inner feeling or voice that guides moral behavior, is relevant to psychological concepts such as sociomoral competence, self-regulation, and moral struggles. But how do people decide whether to follow their conscience? Their decisions may depend partly on the beliefs they hold about the importance and reliability of their conscience—beliefs that, in turn, might be linked to religious/spiritual variables. By examining these ideas among U.S. adult Mechanical Turk workers (N = 305) with many preregistered hypotheses, this study provides some conceptual and empirical groundwork for incorporating conscience-related beliefs into models linking spirituality with mental health. This project required creation of new multi-item conscience measures to assess several beliefs about the conscience: its importance, its reliability, and how often people follow their conscience. All new measures provided good preliminary evidence of reliability and validity. Results showed that most participants view their conscience as very important and reliable and report following their conscience often when making decisions. As shown in path analyses, religiosity and believing that God can influence the conscience both predicted greater sanctification of one’s conscience; sanctification predicted seeing one’s conscience as more important and reliable, which predicted greater reports of following one’s conscience in everyday life. Believing that the devil can influence one’s conscience was linked with seeing one’s conscience as less reliable. In sum, self-reported readiness to follow one’s conscience shows clear connections with religious/spiritual variables and beliefs about the importance and reliability of one’s conscience.

Based on Freud’s argument that the breast’s function in infant development goes beyond the purely nutritional, as libidinal drive gains its power from being propped upon a bodily function necessary to preserve life, we tentatively explore the possible interplay between breastfeeding and ESR. Above and beyond its well-recognized function as a distress modulator for the infant, we draw on a range of knowledge sources to hypothesize that, provided basic conditions are in place, breastfeeding holds a potential for sensual, affective, and erotic gratification for the mother likewise. We propose a paradigm according to which the possibility of embodied breastfeeding to generate a mutual experience of pleasure, intimacy, and desire can serve two interconnected purposes. First, if experienced as fulfilling and pleasurable, breastfeeding may allow for effective dyadic attunement while alleviating the emotional labor of regulating the infant’s emotions. Second, we posit that mutually gratifying breastfeeding may facilitate the development of affective, relational, and protosexual experiences among children that can positively affect ESR, as well as how they may later relate to desire, affect, and intimacy. Conversely, we wonder whether early deprivation or uneroticized breastfeeding could lead to disturbances in the development of the attachment and pleasure systems, which in turn could manifest as a disruption of ESR, relational and sexual processes, and may result in adult psychopathology.

This study examined to what degree findings from previous network analyses, estimated using data from the Dynamic Supervision Project (N = 803; van den Berg et al., 2020), could be replicated. Method: Networks produced with data from the provincial corrections system of British Columbia (N = 4,511) were compared with those found in the original sample, using the Network Comparison Test (van Borkulo et al., 2019) and by correlating both the adjacency matrices of the networks and the rank of the node’s strength centrality across networks. Results: Networks without recidivism, with sexual recidivism, and with violent recidivism (including sexual contact) statistically significant differ in network structure, but not in global strength. Both the adjacency matrices of the networks as well as the rank of the node’s strength centrality across networks were highly correlated. Dynamic risk factors general social rejection/loneliness, lack of concern for others, poor cognitive problem-solving, and impulsive acts showed high-strength centralities. Besides, all networks contained distinct communities of risk factors related to sexual self-regulation, emotionally intimate relationships, antisocial traits, and self-management. Conclusions: We successfully replicated most findings of our original study. Dynamic risk factors concerning social rejection/loneliness, cognitive problem-solving skills, impulsive behavior, and callousness appear to have a relatively strong role in the risk of sexual reoffending. Risk management and treatment strategies to reduce recidivism would benefit from a stronger focus on these dynamic risk factors. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Method: Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional cohort of 59 participants with chronic TBI. We grouped participants as underestimators, fair estimators, and overestimators of their memory and executive functioning. We then compared these groups by global self-awareness measures, other clinical measures, and pre- to-posttest change in self-appraisal of cognitive performance. Results: Analyses revealed no significant differences in global self-awareness measures or depression between fair or underestimators and overestimators in Memory or Executive Function Domains. Only 12.50\% of participants in the Memory Composite Domain and 6.89\% of participants in the Executive Function Composite Domain changed their pre- to postneuropsychological test self-appraisal of cognitive ability. Conclusion: This study revealed most participants did not change their self-appraisal in response to completing neuropsychological testing alone. In conjunction with our findings that suggest global self-awareness measures may not adequately capture domain-specific self-awareness deficits in chronic TBI, this study provides support for development of targeted self-awareness assessment tools and the need for structured feedback, rather than naturalistic feedback alone, to improve self-awareness in chronic TBI.

	abstract = {Objective: Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health issue associated with deleterious mental and medical health comorbidities, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The hallmark symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS), even when not meeting the threshold for a diagnosis of PTSD, appear to be underpinned by poor self-regulation in multiple domains, including emotion, cognitive control, and physiological stress. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) holds promise for treating PTS symptoms because evidence suggests it targets these domains. The current study was a pilot randomized clinical trial designed to examine changes in emotion regulation, attentional function, and physiological stress dysregulation among women IPV survivors with elevated PTS symptoms after participation in a group-based, 8-week MBSR program. Method: In total, 29 participants were randomized to receive MBSR (n = 19) or an active control (n = 10). Assessments were conducted at study entry, as well as 8 and 12 weeks later. Results: Between-group differences on primary outcomes were nonsignificant; however, when exploring within groups, statistically significant decreases in PTS symptoms, F(1.37, 16.53) = 5.19, p p Conclusions: These preliminary data signal that MBSR may improve PTS symptoms and emotion regulation and suggest further study of the effectiveness of PTSD interventions guided by integrative models of MBSR mechanisms and psychophysiological models of stress regulation.

	abstract = {Objective: Normative feedback remains an effective approach to reducing alcohol use among college students. However, this approach is difficult to extend to protective behavioral strategies (PBS), which are proximal to alcohol-related problems. Deviance regulation theory (DRT) is a social psychology theory that posits individuals engage in behaviors to standout out in positive ways or avoid standing out in negative ways. The current study tests a DRT-based randomized control trial. Method: College student drinkers (n = 130) reported on PBS norm frequency, alcohol use, and PBS use. They were then randomly assigned to receive a positive message about PBS users, a negative message about non-PBS users, or a control. They reported on weekly PBS use, alcohol use, and alcohol problems for 10 weeks. Results: Consistent with DRT, there were immediate postintervention effects on PBS use for individuals who believed PBS was uncommon and who also received a positive message. This remained stable across time. There was significant growth in PBS use among individuals who received a negative message and who believed PBS use was common. The intervention was not directly associated with alcohol use or problems. However, PBS use was associated with average alcohol use and lower weekly and global alcohol problems. Conclusions: This study shows that a DRT intervention may increase PBS use. This may translate into lower alcohol use and fewer alcohol-related problems. The results also identify conditions under which positive and negative messages are indicated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

Research shows biofeedback interventions are efficacious in improving awareness and perceived control over internal states, potentially translating to better impulse control. Much of the research on biofeedback interventions for impulsivity, however, focuses on children and adolescents with attentional disorders. This pilot study evaluated the efficacy of biofeedback for improving self-regulation related to impulsivity in adults without a specific diagnosis. Undergraduate volunteers (n = 30) with reported impulsivity were randomly assigned to receive 3 sessions of either cognitive–behavioral (CB) intervention plus biofeedback training, or the CB intervention alone. The CB intervention consisted of exposure to stressful stimuli, guided relaxation training, and mindfulness. Results indicated that biofeedback training did not improve the efficacy of the CB intervention, but that self-reported impulse control improved from pre- to posttreatment for both treatment conditions. Future directions include research with larger samples, comparisons to waitlist control or more distinct interventions, and the evaluation of different biofeedback protocols for the treatment of adults with impulse control deficits. The development and dissemination of CB interventions that address impulse control deficits transdiagnostically has the potential to improve treatment outcomes for populations struggling with a wide range of disorders.

	abstract = {Overeating and resulting obesity is a public health concern in the United States, and portion size is a factor that contributes to these problems (Zlatevska, Dubelaar, \& Holden, 2014). The present research demonstrates that the granularity of labels used to describe portions also influences food consumption, independent of previously documented portion size effects. Across 6 studies and 7 different food items, we find a robust and reliable effect of portion size granularity labels on consumption intentions and food consumption. Having people think about food using fine-grained labels leads them to decrease their consumption intentions (Study 1, n = 80) and ultimately eat less food (Study 2a, n = 79; Study 2b, n = 79). This process operates by shifting people’s perceptions of the size of foods (rather than changing levels of construal) whereby portions described with fine-grained labels (e.g., “15 gummy candies”) are perceived to be bigger than portions described with gross-grained labels (e.g., “one serving;” Study 3, n = 200). In addition, granularity facilitates self-regulation of consumption for individuals with a weight-loss goal both when self-regulation is measured (Study 4, n = 160) and when we manipulate that mediator (Study 5, n = 300). Finally, a high-powered registered report replicated effects of granularity on consumption via shifts in perception and intentions with a diverse community sample (Study 6, n = 323). Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Zalewski et al. recommend that clinicians screen parenting stress, satisfaction, and quality as part of their standard intake process for clients who are parents, and they note evidence on the substantial, though nonspecific, association between parent and offspring psychopathology. Because much of this association may be accounted for by shared biological and environmental risk, it is not entirely clear how much of the variance in child outcomes may be accounted for by variations in parenting behavior that could be addressed in therapy. The ideas proposed by Zalewski et al. highlight significant challenges in relation to assessment, intervention design and content, and monitoring of treatment response when clinical care is provided to adults who are parents. One challenge is that of blending a focus on parent-, dyad-, and family level factors within a single adult therapy episode. Another challenge is identifying and addressing self regulation issues that can impact functioning at all three levels. A third challenge is personalizing treatment, arguably a requirement for effective clinical care—that is, fitting research-derived principles and procedures to the distinctive characteristics and needs of adult clients and the children whose lives they touch.

The study’s setting was an art therapy and mindfulness studio (Inhabited Studio) in Hong Kong where participants engaged in art making and in mindfulness-meditation practice. Results: Different aspects of the Inhabited Studio appealed to participants based on each individual’s worldview, culture, religion, and coping style. Responses to the Inhabited Studio were organized into 7 thematic clusters. Five themes were categorized into 2 broad categories composed of personal elements (memory, identity) and mediating aspects (emotional/self-regulation, communication, and imagination). The final 2, resilience and worldview, spanned both areas. Conclusions: Participants found the Inhabited Studio culturally compatible and some of the skills they learned helpful in times of stress.

Five studies provide initial, primarily correlative support for the undermining effect of investing in a backup plan.

Studies 2–4 used a simulated negotiation task. Study 2 (n = 247) demonstrated that when goal-relevant resources are limited, investing in developing backup plans and perceiving them as highly instrumental can decrease goal performance through the indirect effect of increased means replacing. Study 3 (n = 248) replicated this effect when goal-relevant resources were plentiful. Study 4 (n = 204) used an experimental variant of the simulated negotiation task and demonstrated that simply having a backup plan is not detrimental, but perceiving backup plans to be highly instrumental decreased goal performance, again through the indirect effect of increased means replacing. Study 5 (n = 160) replicated findings from Studies 1–4 using a lab-based motor task (throwing a ball). Together, these results provide first evidence that backup plans can introduce costs that may jeopardize goal performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Alongside pharmacotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the second evidence-supported treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults. ADHD is increasingly understood as a disorder of poor self-regulation. This core difficulty creates the many downstream functional impairments associated with a lifetime diagnosis of ADHD. CBT targets the procrastination, disorganization, poor time management, and so forth that create the problems in daily life for which ADHD adults seek help, particularly emphasizing skills-based behavior change and skills performance. The relevance of the cognitive domain of CBT for adult ADHD has often been viewed as limited to the degree to which it is needed to treat comorbid depression or anxiety. However, recent research and treatment approaches highlight the relevance of cognitive distortions in the conceptualization and psychosocial treatment of adult ADHD. The aim of this paper is to review the recent and converging research on the impact and clinical relevance of cognitive distortions and other mindsets in understanding and treating adults with ADHD. A review of the contemporary model of ADHD as a problem of self-regulation and the associated functional impairments points to the need for comprehensive treatment. The empirical support for CBT adapted for adult ADHD as the psychosocial treatment of choice will then be briefly reviewed, augmented with emerging research highlighting cognitive distortions in samples of adults with ADHD. Lastly, clinically relevant examples of cognitive interventions used in CBT for adult ADHD will be presented to tie together research and clinical practice.

Results: After controlling for predeployment avoidant coping and overall social support, higher unit cohesion was associated with a reduction in avoidant coping (from P1 to P3). This reduction in avoidant coping (from P1 to P3) mediated the relationship between unit cohesion (P2) and improvement in mental health function (from P1 to P3). Conclusions: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher unit cohesion may mitigate increases in avoidant coping in military personnel after a combat deployment and in turn may improve mental health function.

In fact, adults with ADHD will often state that the crux of their frustrations is that they know what they need to do but are nonetheless unable to turn their intentions into actions. Existing diagnostic criteria do not fully capture the underlying problems related to the self-regulation and motivational deficits experienced by patients that result in these performance problems, nor do these criteria sufficiently inform psychosocial treatment. The aims of this article are (a) to describe the clinical significance of the self-regulation difficulties and motivational deficits associated with ADHD, (b) to review recent etiologic models that provide a comprehensive and integrative framework for understanding the often diverse clinical presentation of adults with ADHD and, (c) to illustrate how these models help to inform psychosocial treatment, particularly how cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for adult ADHD continues to evolve to address the underlying deficits that commonly interfere with treatment progress. CBT for adult ADHD emphasizes strategies and tactics designed to promote the implementation of coping skills to improve functioning in this clinical population.

However, previous investigations focused only on behavior intentions or health risk behaviors, and did not investigate the role of emotions. This study expands on this research using a small-scale meta-analysis approach with our own data sets to examine the associations of self-compassion with a set of health-promoting behaviors, and test the roles of high positive affect and low negative affect as potential explanatory mechanisms. Method: Fifteen independent samples (N = 3,252) with correlations of self-compassion with the frequency of self-reported health-promoting behaviors (eating habits, exercise, sleep behaviors, and stress management) were meta-analyzed. Eight of these samples completed measures of positive and negative affect. Results: Self-compassion was positively associated with the practice of health-promoting behaviors across all 15 samples. The meta-analysis revealed a small effect size (average r = .25; p {\textless} .001) of self-compassion and health behaviors, with low variability. Tests of the indirect effects of self-compassion on health behaviors through positive and negative affect with multiple mediator analyses revealed small effects for each. Separate meta-analyses of the indirect effects (IE) were significant for positive (average IE = .08; p {\textless} .001) and negative affect (average IE = .06; p {\textless} .001), and their combined indirect effects (average IE = .15; p {\textless} .0001). Conclusion: Self-compassion may be an important quality to cultivate for promoting positive health behaviors, due in part to its association with adaptive emotions.

Although the incorrect spellings which were practiced in the initial learning phase (acquisition phase) were extinguished in the subsequent learning phase (extinction phase), the erroneous spellings recovered after a break of 24 hr in the delayed correction condition. The results indicate that learning with methods that emphasize phonological spelling, without correction in the initial learning phase, can lead to spontaneous recovery of initially learned incorrect spellings after the incorrect spellings have seemingly been extinguished.

Here, we investigate how unbalanced bilinguals’ language-specific emotions vary depending on differences in language processing automaticity versus in language learning and use contexts. We analyzed behavioral emotional reactions in a hypothetical decision-making task with low emotional appeal, the Asian disease problem (Study 1) and pupil and valence responses to authentic narrative video advertising with high emotional appeal (Study 2). Both studies replicated the L2 emotion disadvantage. In decision-making, L2 reactions paralleled first language reactions under perceptual load. During the L2 narrative, the pupil dilated less because of reduced lexical access automaticity rather than in response to language-context factors. The findings suggest that bilinguals have language-independent emotional representations. Yet, they process emotional information conveyed in L2 less automatically, which triggers weaker emotional reactions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Listeners heard sequences of “ABA–” triplets, where “A” and “B” were tones of different frequencies and “–” was a silent gap. Segregation was more frequently reported, and rhythmically deviant triplets less well detected, for a greater between-tone frequency separation and later in the sequence. In Experiment 1, performing a competing auditory task for the first part of the sequence led to a reduction in subsequent streaming compared to when the tones were attended throughout. This is consistent with focused attention promoting streaming, and/or with attention switches resetting it. However, the proportion of segregated reports increased more rapidly following a switch than at the start of a sequence, indicating that some streaming occurred automatically. Modeling ruled out a simple “covert attention” account of this finding. Experiment 2 required listeners to perform subjective and objective tasks concurrently. It revealed superior performance during integrated compared to segregated reports, beyond that explained by the codependence of the two measures on stimulus parameters. We argue that listeners have limited access to low-level stimulus representations once perceptual organization has occurred, and that subjective and objective streaming measures partly index the same processes.

Readers with dyslexia are considered to have less “automatized” access to lexical information, reflected in longer RAN times compared with nondyslexic readers. We combined the RAN task with a Stroop-switch manipulation to test the automaticity of dyslexic and nondyslexic readers’ lexical access directly within a fluency task. Participants named letters in 10 × 4 arrays while eye movements and speech responses were recorded. Upon fixation, specific letter font colors changed from black to a different color, whereupon the participant was required to rapidly switch from naming the letter to naming the letter color. We could therefore measure reading group differences on “automatic” lexical processing, insofar as it was task-irrelevant. Readers with dyslexia showed obligatory lexical processing and a timeline for recognition that was overall similar to typical readers, but a delay emerged in the output (naming) phase. Further delay was caused by visual–orthographic competition between neighboring stimuli. Our findings outline the specific processes involved when researchers speak of “impaired automaticity” in dyslexic readers’ fluency, and are discussed in the context of the broader literature in this field.

A general model of individual-level subtask learning was proposed focusing on power and exponential functions with constraints to test for inconsistency. To study subtask learning, we developed a novel computer-based booking task, which logged participant actions, enabling measurement of strategy use and subtask performance. Model comparison was performed using deviance information criterion (DIC), posterior predictive checks, plots of model fits, and model recovery simulations. Results showed that although learning tended to be monotonically decreasing and decelerating, and approaching an asymptote for all subtasks, there was substantial inconsistency in learning curves both at the group- and individual-levels. This inconsistency was most apparent when constraining both the rate and the ratio of learning to asymptote to be equal across subtasks, thereby giving learning curves only 1 parameter for scaling. The inclusion of 6 strategy covariates provided improved prediction of subtask performance capturing different subtask learning processes and subtask trade-offs. In addition, strategy use partially explained the inconsistency in subtask learning. Overall, the model provided a more nuanced representation of how complex tasks can be decomposed in terms of simpler learning mechanisms.

The current meta-analysis is the first aggregate test of this proposed causal model. Method: A systematic literature review, using stringent inclusion criteria, identified 16 reports describing 12 primary studies. We used review methods to calculate the inverse-variance-weighted pooled correlation coefficient for the therapist-to-client and the client-to-outcome paths across multiple targeted behaviors (i.e., alcohol or illicit drug use, other addictive behaviors). Results: Therapist MI-consistent skills were correlated with more client language in favor of behavior change (i.e., change talk; r = .26, p {\textless} .0001), but not less client language against behavior change (i.e., sustain talk; r = .10, p = .09). MI-inconsistent skills were associated with less change talk (r = −.17, p = .001) as well as more sustain talk (r = .07, p = .009). Among these studies, client change talk was not associated with follow-up outcome (r = .06, p = .41), but sustain talk was associated with worse outcome (r = −.24, p = .001). In addition, studies examining composite client language (e.g., an average of negative and positive statements) showed an overall positive relationship with client behavior change (r = .12, p = .006; k = 6). Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides an initial test and partial support for a key causal model of MI efficacy.

	doi = {10.1037/a0038285},
	abstract = {When singing a melody or producing sentences, we take for granted the fact that the sounds we create (auditory feedback) match the intended consequences of our actions. The importance of these perception/action matches to production is illustrated by the detrimental effects of altered auditory feedback (AAF). Previous research in the domain of music has shown that when AAF leads to asynchronies between perception and action, timing of production is disrupted but accuracy of sequencing is not. On the other hand, AAF manipulations of pitch disrupt sequencing but not timing. Such dissociative effects, as well as other findings, suggest that sensitivity to AAF may be based on hierarchical organization of sequences. In the current research we examined whether similar effects are found for the production of speech, for which syllables rather than pitches may constitute content units. In the first experiment, participants either sang melodies or spoke sequences of nonsense syllables. In the second experiment, the tasks were combined such that participants sang syllable sequences. Production in both experiments was accompanied by either normal, asynchronous, or content altered auditory feedback. Across experiments, effects of AAF on the accuracy of sequencing were similar in speaking and singing tasks, and in all cases reflected the dissociative effects described earlier. For timing of production, however, previous results were only found when participants sang sequences that did not have varying syllabic content. These results suggest that sensitivity to timing exists at multiple hierarchical levels, particularly at the syllable and phonetic levels.

In this article, the cognitive effort explanation for the CI effect was examined by investigating the role of error processing. In 2 experiments, a perceptual-cognitive task was used in which participants anticipated 3 different tennis skills across a pretest, 3 practice sessions, and retention test. During practice, the skills were presented in either a random or blocked practice order. In Experiment 1, cognitive effort was examined using a probe reaction time (RT) task. In Experiment 2, cognitive effort was manipulated for 2 groups by inserting a cognitively demanding secondary task into the intertrial interval. The CI effect was found in both experiments as the random groups displayed superior learning in the retention test compared with the blocked groups. Cognitive effort during practice was greater in random compared to blocked practice groups in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, greater decrements in secondary task performance following an error were reported for the random group when compared with the blocked group. The suggestion is that not only the frequent switching of tasks in randomized orders causes increased cognitive effort and the CI effect, but it is also error processing in combination with task switching. Findings extend the cognitive effort explanation for the CI effect and propose an alternative hypothesis highlighting the role of error processing.

A sensitivity to cues and a proclivity to rapidly acquire patterns during routinized tasks, however, can miscue performance when these patterns change. In the present study, 75 university students undertook an assessment of cue utilization and engaged in a 24-min rail control simulation. The rail control task involved monitoring with periodic interventions to reroute trains, according to a train-track matching rule. A hidden pattern in the sequencing of trains presented an opportunity to predict train movements and reduce the workload. This pattern was programmed to abruptly change 3 times during the rail task. Based on the response latency performance of participants and their detection of the rail task pattern (verbal descriptions), the results suggested that individuals who are sensitive to cues and who also detect patterns of dynamic stimuli (following limited exposure) experience a relatively greater risk of misapplying rules or misdiagnosing situations in routinized environments when stimuli change. Following a temporary decline in performance, however, if there are continued pattern changes, the performance of these individuals will remain unaffected.

In contrast, Rawson and Touron (2009) demonstrated a relatively rapid shift to memory-based processing in the context of a reading task. The current research extended beyond this initial study to provide more definitive evidence for relative preservation of memory-based automaticity in reading tasks for older adults. Younger and older adults read short stories containing unfamiliar noun phrases (e.g., skunk mud) followed by disambiguating information indicating the combination’s meaning (either the normatively dominant meaning or an alternative subordinate meaning). Stories were repeated across practice blocks, and then the noun phrases were presented in novel sentence frames in a transfer task. Both age groups shifted from computation to retrieval after relatively few practice trials (as evidenced by convergence of reading times for dominant and subordinate items). Most important, both age groups showed strong evidence for memory-based processing of the noun phrases in the transfer task. In contrast, older adults showed minimal shifting to retrieval in an alphabet arithmetic task, indicating that the preservation of memory-based automaticity in reading was task-specific. Discussion focuses on important implications for theories of memory-based automaticity in general and for specific theoretical accounts of age effects on memory-based automaticity, as well as fruitful directions for future research.

In Experiment 1, participants typed the same words or nonwords in 5 consecutive trials while performing a concurrent memory task.

In both experiments, recognition of typing materials was associated with better chunking of the materials. Experiment 3 used the remember-know procedure to test the recollection and familiarity components of recognition. Remember judgments were associated with better chunking than know judgments or nonrecognition. These results indicate that chunking is associated with explicit recollection of prior typing episodes.

We present four multi-item experiments with German–English bilinguals. An initial eye-tracked primed choice task established that homophones affect decision making. Three visual preference experiments with written and/or auditory primes and high- or low-proficiency L2 users found that homophones bias preferences more in L1 than L2. The L1–L2 gap widened if listening or low proficiency made suppression more difficult. We argue that the interplay between reduced suppression in L2 as predicted by activation–suppression models and lower subjective frequency of L2 homophones assumed by the frequency lag hypothesis explain the size of the L1–L2 priming gap.

Men in the sad actor condition exhibited greater engagement (smiled more, gestured more) and their partners showed stronger physiologic linkage than men in the control condition. Conversely, women in the sad actor condition were less expressive than women in the control condition (smiled less), and their partners showed weaker physiologic linkage to them compared to dyads in the control condition.

	abstract = {We investigate how children form early grammatical generalizations using the test case of the English regular plural. While some previous studies demonstrate that children apply abstract grammatical rules to produce novel plurals before 24 months, other studies have revealed that children use plural forms inconsistently with familiar and novel nouns and demonstrate limited or variable receptive plural knowledge through 36 months. This is at odds with typical trajectories in language development, where receptive knowledge precedes expressive knowledge. However, previous studies tested receptive and expressive knowledge in different samples and differences in experimental materials across studies limit interpretability. In a cross-sectional design, across three studies, we tested one hundred twenty-eight 24- to 36-month-olds on two complementary experimental tasks: a receptive (eyetracking) task to evaluate children’s understanding of plurals and an expressive (storybook) task to test their plural production. In the former, children heard sentences directing their gaze to an onscreen plural or singular target. In the latter, they heard a singular object labeled and a prompt eliciting their plural production. We manipulated both novelty (novel vs. familiar object words; e.g., “cats” vs. “wugs”) and phonological form (/s/ vs. /z/ plurals; e.g., “cats” vs. “dogs”). We found strong, age-related evidence of expressive knowledge of the plural, but much more limited evidence of receptive knowledge. Performance on the expressive task only predicted performance on the receptive task that included additional grammatical cues (e.g., “there are two wugs” vs. “can you find the wugs?”). This work highlights the complexity of emerging grammatical generalizations in language acquisition and emphasizes the role of redundant grammatical cues in processing.

First, we investigate how aligning messages’ moral framing with participants’ moral values impacts participants’ intentions to share true and false news headlines and whether this effect is driven by a lack of analytical thinking. Our results show that framing a post such that it aligns with audiences’ moral values leads to increased sharing intentions, independent of headline familiarity, and participants’ political ideology but find no effect of analytical thinking. Furthermore, we find that moral alignment facilitates sharing misinformation more so than true information. Next, we use natural language processing to determine messages’ moral framing and senders’ political ideology. We find that an alignment of moral framing and ideology facilitates the spread of misinformation. Our findings suggest that (a) targeting audiences’ core values can be used to influence the dissemination of (mis)information on social media platforms; (b) partisan divides in misinformation sharing can be, at least partially, explained through alignment between audiences’ underlying moral values and moral framing that often accompanies content shared online; and (c) this effect is driven by motivational factors.

	abstract = {A central goal of research into language acquisition is explaining how, when learners generalize to new cases, they appropriately restrict their generalizations (e.g., to avoid producing ungrammatical utterances such as *the clown laughed the man; “*” indicates an ungrammatical form). The past 30 years have seen an unresolved debate between statistical preemption and entrenchment as explanations. Under preemption, the use of a verb in a particular construction (e.g., *the clown laughed the man) is probabilistically blocked by hearing that other verb constructions with similar meanings only (e.g., the clown made the man laugh). Under entrenchment, such errors (e.g., *the clown laughed the man) are probabilistically blocked by hearing any utterance that includes the relevant verb (e.g., by the clown made the man laugh and the man laughed). Across five artificial-language-learning studies, we designed a training regime such that learners received evidence for the (by the relevant hypothesis) ungrammaticality of a particular unattested verb/noun + particle combination (e.g., *chila + kem; *squeako + kem) via either preemption only or entrenchment only. Across all five studies, participants in the preemption condition (as per our preregistered prediction) rated unattested verb/noun + particle combinations as less acceptable for restricted verbs/nouns, which appeared during training, than for unrestricted, novel-at-test verbs/nouns, which did not appear during training, that is, strong evidence for preemption. Participants in the entrenchment condition showed no evidence for such an effect (and in 3/5 experiments, positive evidence for the null). We conclude that a successful model of learning linguistic restrictions must instantiate competition between different forms only where they express the same (or similar) meanings.

Studies have highlighted the degeneration of the corpus callosum, particularly in its anterior segments, as individuals age. This prompts an essential question regarding the potential functional repercussions of these structural changes on interhemispheric communication among older adults. Two experiments were conducted to explore potential compromises in the interhemispheric transfer of visual working memory (VWM) in older adults. Both young individuals (aged 18–28 years) and healthy older adults (aged 65–85 years) engaged in modified versions of the one-back paradigm. In this task, stimuli were sequentially presented in either the left or right hemifield, and participants indicated whether each stimulus matched the preceding one. Notably, when two stimuli are matched, they could appear either in the same hemifield or in opposite hemifields. The results revealed that, in comparison to young adults, older adults demonstrated a significant increase in matching errors when the two stimuli were presented in opposite hemifields rather than the same hemifield. This new finding strongly suggests a reduced interhemispheric transfer of VWM in older adults, potentially attributed to age-related atrophy in the anterior part of the corpus callosum.

Despite its importance, concept learning has received less attention in the field of cognitive aging compared to areas such as episodic memory and cognitive control, and there has yet to be a synthesis of age-related findings in this domain. In this review, we summarize the findings from empirical studies investigating age-related differences in categorization—a domain within concept learning that involves linking items to a shared label and allows for classification of novel members of the category. We focus on several hypotheses about what might drive age-related differences in categorization, including differences in perceptual clustering, the ability to form specific and generalized category representations, performance on tasks that are thought to recruit different memory systems, attention to stimulus features, and strategic and metacognitive processes. Overall, the existing literature suggests that older and younger adults may differ in the way they approach learning new categories, and this difference emerges across several different categorization tasks and category structures. We conclude by encouraging future research that takes advantage of the strong existing theoretical foundations in both the concept learning and cognitive aging domains. This approach has the potential to broaden our understanding of the factors that influence category formation across the adult lifespan and provide a more complete picture of age-related differences across multiple cognitive domains.

	abstract = {Categories are fundamental to everyday life and the ability to learn new categories is relevant across the lifespan. Categories are ubiquitous across modalities, supporting complex processes such as object recognition and speech perception. Prior work has proposed that different categories may engage learning systems with unique developmental trajectories. There is a limited understanding of how perceptual and cognitive development influences learning as prior studies have examined separate participants in a single modality. The current study presents a comprehensive assessment of category learning in 8–12-year-old children (12 female; 34 white, 1 Asian, 1 more than one race; M household income \$85–\$100 K) and 18–61-year-old adults (13 female; 32 white, 10 Black or African American, 4 Asian, 2 more than one race, 1 other; M household income \$40–55 K) in a broad sample collected online from the United States. Across multiple sessions, participants learned categories across modalities (auditory, visual) that engage different learning systems (explicit, procedural). Unsurprisingly, adults outperformed children across all tasks. However, this enhanced performance was asymmetrical across categories and modalities. Adults far outperformed children in learning visual explicit categories and auditory procedural categories, with fewer differences across development for other types of categories. Adults’ general benefit over children was due to enhanced information processing, while their superior performance for visual explicit and auditory procedural categories was associated with less cautious correct responses. These results demonstrate an interaction between perceptual and cognitive development that influences learning of categories that may correspond to the development of real-world skills such as speech perception and reading.

Few studies have approached the developmental study of turn-transition durations in infancy, and most examine turn-taking only in the context of face-to-face or object-oriented playful interaction. But none has compared the effects of each mode of play in turn-transition duration. Method: We analyzed the vocalizations of 25 mother–infant dyads in a semistructured interaction with three tasks: (1) free-play with toys, (2) free-play without toys, and (3) challenging-object play. Gap and overlap frequency and duration were measured, and the effects of age point (7, 12 months), task (1, 2, 3), and direction of turn-transition (infant, mother) assessed using generalized linear mixed modeling for each dependent variable (DV: gaps, overlaps). Results: Gap durations were substantially shorter, and overlap durations had greater variability, in the free-play without objects condition. There were significant differences between face-to-face and object-oriented conditions for both DV’s. Only for gaps, all fixed-effects (age, task, direction), and their two-way interactions, were significant. Posthoc pairwise comparisons found that, in object-oriented conditions, infants maintain similar durations between age points, unlike their mothers. In the face-to-face condition, infants and mothers had the same descending tendency between age points. Conclusions: Interactions without objects produce shorter gap durations and may reveal developmental changes in turn-taking. Research should account for the methodological and theoretical implications of this effect. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {How individuals learn complex regularities in the environment and generalize them to new instances is a key question in cognitive science. Although previous investigations have advocated the idea that learning and generalizing depend upon separate processes, the same basic learning mechanisms may account for both. In language learning experiments, these mechanisms have typically been studied in isolation of broader cognitive phenomena such as memory, perception, and attention. Here, we show how learning and generalization in language is embedded in these broader theories by testing learners on their ability to chunk nonadjacent dependencies—a key structure in language but a challenge to theories that posit learning through the memorization of structure. In two studies, adult participants were trained and tested on an artificial language containing nonadjacent syllable dependencies, using a novel chunking-based serial recall task involving verbal repetition of target sequences (formed from learned strings) and scrambled foils. Participants recalled significantly more syllables, bigrams, trigrams, and nonadjacent dependencies from sequences conforming to the language’s statistics (both learned and generalized sequences). They also encoded and generalized specific nonadjacent chunk information. These results suggest that participants chunk remote dependencies and rapidly generalize this information to novel structures. The results thus provide further support for learning-based approaches to language acquisition, and link statistical learning to broader cognitive mechanisms of memory.

However, an understanding of neurocognitive processes of elaborated feedback during instructor–learner interactions remains elusive. Here, a two-person interactive design is used during simultaneous recording of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals from adult instructor–learner dyads. Instructors either provided elaborated feedback (i.e., correct answer and an example) or simple feedback (i.e., correct answer only) to learners during a concept learning task. Our results show that elaborated feedback produced comparable levels of retention to simple feedback; however, transfer was significantly enhanced by elaboration. We also noted significant instructor–learner neural synchronization in frontoparietal regions during the provision of elaborated feedback, especially when examples were provided. Further, interpersonal neural synchronization in the parietal cortex successfully predicted transfer of knowledge to novel contexts. This prediction was retained for both learner-delayed and learner-preceding neural synchronization. These findings point toward transfer effects of elaborated feedback provided in a social context can be predictable through interpersonal neural synchronization, which may hold important implications for real-world learning and pedagogical efficacy.

Using a dichotic listening task, which assesses auditory divided attention, benefits of a rightward prism adaptation were demonstrated in neglect patients (i.e., a syndrome following right hemisphere brain damage) by reducing their left auditory extinction. It is currently unknown whether prism adaptation affects auditory divided attention in healthy subjects. In the present study, we investigated the aftereffects of prism adaptation on dichotic listening. Method: A sample of 47 young adults performed a dichotic listening task, in which pairs of words were presented with two words sounded simultaneously, one in each ear. Three parameters were measured: The percentage of recalled words, the percentage of correctly recalled words, and the laterality index (LI). Results: Prism adaptation to a leftward optical deviation (L-PA) significantly increased the overall percentage of recalled words (p = .044) and that from the right ear (p = .002), and the overall LI (p = .049). Conclusions: For the first time, these findings demonstrate that L-PA produced an orientation of the auditory divided attention in favor of the right ear in healthy participants. This asymmetrical aftereffect provides a new argument in favor of the cross-modal dimension of prism adaptation, although an acclimatization effect of the dichotic listening task is also discussed. Our study opens up a new avenue for using prism adaptation in the field of auditory rehabilitation requiring a modulation of auditory attention.

Ample training studies showing transfer were criticized for flawed design. We now explored the impact of perceptual training (auditory frequency discrimination), applying a carefully controlled intensive training experiment. First, we administered a battery of perceptual, linguistic, and cognitive tasks to a large population to determine “near” to “far” tasks according to (pretraining) correlations in performance. This assessment revealed significant correlations between simple pitch discrimination and complex linguistic tasks, including reading and syntactic reasoning. Second, we administered a broad test battery before (and after) training, which included several tasks assessing pitch discrimination, and the linguistic tasks that showed pretraining correlation with auditory frequency discrimination. The test group trained with 2 tone frequency discrimination for 40 sessions. An active control group trained with a working memory (n-back) task for the same duration, and a passive control group was only tested before and after training. Pretraining performance levels were similar in the three groups. Our results were straightforward. No transfer was found to untrained tasks that rely on pith discrimination, or to linguistic tasks that showed pretraining correlation. Mild to marginal transfer was found only to pitch discrimination tasks using almost exactly the trained protocol. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

We familiarized learners with continuous artificial speech comprising repetitions of target words, which were preceded by high-frequency marker words. Crucially, marker words distinguished targets into 2 distributionally defined categories. We measured learning with segmentation and categorization tests and compared performance against a control group that heard the artificial speech without these marker words (i.e., just the targets, with no cues for categorization). Participants segmented the target words from speech in both conditions, but critically when the marker words were present, they influenced acquisition of word-referent mappings in a subsequent transfer task, with participants demonstrating better early learning for mappings that were consistent (rather than inconsistent) with the distributional categories. We propose that high-frequency words may assist early grammatical categorization, while speech segmentation is still being learned. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Recent reports suggest that exposure to complex elements leads to more widespread changes. However, whether learning via exposure to complex or to simple elements is more beneficial is a matter of ongoing debate. In the current study, using behavioral and electrophysiological measures, we aimed at understanding this by comparing subjects trained with complex speech sounds with those trained with simple speech sounds in a 5-day pseudoword-picture training paradigm. We found that though the subjects learned both complex and simple speech sounds to similar degrees, subjects who were trained with complex stimuli demonstrated more generalizations to novel complex and simple stimuli, whereas those trained with simple stimuli exhibited generalization only to simple but not to complex stimuli (Experiment 1). Along with behavioral measures, using mismatch negativity, we found that training with complex stimuli can lead to more extensive neural changes for both complex and simple stimuli as compared with training with simple stimuli (Experiment 2). In artificial language learning, learning with complex stimuli appears to be more effective than training with simple stimuli as far as generalization is concerned.

	abstract = {Research has shown that adults’ lexical-semantic representations are surprisingly malleable. For instance, the interpretation of ambiguous words (e.g., bark) is influenced by experience such that recently encountered meanings become more readily available (Rodd et al., 2016, 2013). However, the mechanism underlying this word-meaning priming effect remains unclear, and competing accounts make different predictions about the extent to which information about word meanings that is gained within one modality (e.g., speech) is transferred to the other modality (e.g., reading) to aid comprehension. In two Web-based experiments, ambiguous target words were primed with either written or spoken sentences that biased their interpretation toward a subordinate meaning, or were unprimed. About 20 min after the prime exposure, interpretation of these target words was tested by presenting them in either written or spoken form, using word association (Experiment 1, N = 78) and speeded semantic relatedness decisions (Experiment 2, N = 181). Both experiments replicated the auditory unimodal priming effect shown previously (Rodd et al., 2016, 2013) and revealed significant cross-modal priming: primed meanings were retrieved more frequently and swiftly across all primed conditions compared with the unprimed baseline. Furthermore, there were no reliable differences in priming levels between unimodal and cross-modal prime-test conditions. These results indicate that recent experience with ambiguous word meanings can bias the reader’s or listener’s later interpretation of these words in a modality-general way. We identify possible loci of this effect within the context of models of long-term priming and ambiguity resolution. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

What statistical properties drive the acquisition of such constraints? Because they are naturally highly correlated, previous work has been unable to dissociate the contribution of 2 properties: contextual variability (the number of unique phonological contexts in which a phonotactic pattern appears) and exemplar strength (the overall number of times the pattern appears). Using an artificial language learning paradigm, 3 experiments disentangled the effects of variability and strength, indexed by type and token frequency, respectively, on the learning of gradient phonotactics. When the 2 factors were decorrelated (Experiment 2), participants showed greater generalization of patterns advantaged for contextual variability, but not those advantaged for exemplar strength. When the 2 factors were anticorrelated (Experiment 3), participants preferred patterns advantaged in contextual variability, even though they were disadvantaged for exemplar strength. These results suggest that contextual variability is the key force driving phonotactic learning, as it allows learners to home in on the invariant features of the input.

As the perceived sexiness of the music increased, so did the subjective sexiness of the touch stimulations. In short, the perception of sexiness transferred from music to touch.

	abstract = {Cognitive control is essential to resolve conflict in stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) tasks. The SRC effect in the current trial is reduced after an incongruent trial as compared with a congruent trial, a phenomenon being termed conflict adaptation (CA). The CA effect is found to be domain-specific, such that it occurs when adjacent trials contain the same type of conflict, but disappears when the conflicts are of different types. Similar patterns have been observed when tasks involve different modalities, but the modality-specific effect may have been confounded by task switching. In the current study, we investigated whether or not cognitive control could transfer across auditory and visual conflicts when task-switching was controlled. Participants were asked to respond to a visual or auditory (Experiments 1A/B) stimulus, with conflict coming from either the same or a different modality. CA effects showed modality-specific patterns. To account for potential confounding effects caused by differences in task-irrelevant properties, we specifically examined the influence of task-irrelevant properties on CA effects within the visual modality (Experiments 2A/B). Significant CA effects were observed across different conflicts from distinct task-irrelevant properties, ruling out that the lack of cross-modal CA effects in Experiments 1A/B resulted from differences in task-irrelevant information. Task-irrelevant properties were further matched in Experiments 3A/B to examine the pure effect of modality. Results replicated Experiments 1A/B showing robust modality-specific CA effects. Taken together, we provide supporting evidences that modality affects cognitive control in conflict resolution, which should be taken into account in theories of cognitive control.

	abstract = {Listeners usually understand without difficulty even speech that sounds atypical. When they encounter noncanonical realizations of speech sounds, listeners can make short-term adjustments of their long-term representations of those sounds. Previous research, focusing mostly on adaptation in consonants, has suggested that for perceptual adaptation to take place some local cues (lexical, phonotactic, or visual) have to guide listeners’ interpretation of the atypical sounds. In the present experiment we investigated perceptual adaptation in vowels. Our first aim was to show whether perceptual adaptation generalizes to unexposed but phonologically related vowels. To this end, we exposed Greek listeners to words or nonwords containing manipulated /i/ or /e/, and tested whether they adapted their perception of the /i/-/e/ contrast, as well as the unexposed /u/-/o/ contrast, which represents the same phonological height distinction. Our second aim was to test whether perceptual adaptation in vowels requires local context. Thus, a half of our listeners heard the manipulated vowels in real Greek words, while the other half heard them in nonwords providing no phonotactic cues on vowel identity. The results showed similar adjustment of /i/-/e/ categorization and of /u/-/o/ categorization, which indicates generalization of perceptual adaptation across phonologically related vowels. Furthermore, adaptation occurred irrespective of whether local context cues were present or not, suggesting that, at least in vowels, adaptation can be based on the distribution of auditory properties in the input. Our findings, confirming that fast perceptual adaptation in adult listeners occurs even for vowels, highlight the role of phonological abstraction in speech perception.

In a first experiment, participants performed a speaker discrimination task on vowels, volitional (acted) laughter, and spontaneous (authentic) laughter from 5 unfamiliar speakers. We found that performance was significantly impaired for spontaneous laughter, a vocalization produced under reduced volitional control. We additionally found that the detection of identity-related information fails to generalize across different types of nonverbal vocalizations (e.g., laughter vs. vowels) and across mismatches in volitional control within vocalization pairs (e.g., volitional laughter vs. spontaneous laughter), with performance levels indicating an inability to discriminate between speakers. In a second experiment, we explored whether personal familiarity with the speakers would afford greater accuracy and better generalization of identity perception. Using new stimuli, we largely replicated our previous findings: whereas familiarity afforded a consistent performance advantage for speaker discriminations, the experimental manipulations impaired performance to similar extents for familiar and unfamiliar listener groups. We discuss our findings with reference to prototype-based models of voice processing and suggest potential underlying mechanisms and representations of familiar and unfamiliar voice perception.

	abstract = {Infant-directed speech (IDS) has distinctive properties that differ from adult-directed speech (ADS). Why it has these properties—and whether they are intended to facilitate language learning—is a matter of contention. We argue that much of this disagreement stems from lack of a formal, guiding theory of how phonetic categories should best be taught to infantlike learners. In the absence of such a theory, researchers have relied on intuitions about learning to guide the argument. We use a formal theory of teaching, validated through experiments in other domains, as the basis for a detailed analysis of whether IDS is well designed for teaching phonetic categories. Using the theory, we generate ideal data for teaching phonetic categories in English. We qualitatively compare the simulated teaching data with human IDS, finding that the teaching data exhibit many features of IDS, including some that have been taken as evidence IDS is not for teaching. The simulated data reveal potential pitfalls for experimentalists exploring the role of IDS in language learning. Focusing on different formants and phoneme sets leads to different conclusions, and the benefit of the teaching data to learners is not apparent until a sufficient number of examples have been provided. Finally, we investigate transfer of IDS to learning ADS. The teaching data improve classification of ADS data but only for the learner they were generated to teach, not universally across all classes of learners. This research offers a theoretically grounded framework that empowers experimentalists to systematically evaluate whether IDS is for teaching.

	abstract = {Speech perception depends on long-term representations that reflect regularities of the native language. However, listeners rapidly adapt when speech acoustics deviate from these regularities due to talker idiosyncrasies such as foreign accents and dialects. To better understand these dual aspects of speech perception, we probe native English listeners’ baseline perceptual weighting of 2 acoustic dimensions (spectral quality and vowel duration) toward vowel categorization and examine how they subsequently adapt to an “artificial accent” that deviates from English norms in the correlation between the 2 dimensions. At baseline, listeners rely relatively more on spectral quality than vowel duration to signal vowel category, but duration nonetheless contributes. Upon encountering an “artificial accent” in which the spectral-duration correlation is perturbed relative to English language norms, listeners rapidly down-weight reliance on duration. Listeners exhibit this type of short-term statistical learning even in the context of nonwords, confirming that lexical information is not necessary to this form of adaptive plasticity in speech perception. Moreover, learning generalizes to both novel lexical contexts and acoustically distinct altered voices. These findings are discussed in the context of a mechanistic proposal for how supervised learning may contribute to this type of adaptive plasticity in speech perception.

Method: In Experiment 1, to investigate the N170 adaptation effect between faces and printed language, 18 bilingual participants (7 males) were recruited, and the N170 response elicited by faces and words was recorded using a 128-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net. To address whether this asymmetrical between-category N170 adaptation effect generalizes to any object of expertise, in Experiment 2, 19 participants (9 males) were recruited by training to become Greeble experts. The N170 component elicited by faces and Greebles was recorded before and after training. Results: In Experiment 1, the authors found that only faces can affect the N170 response elicited by words but words cannot affect the N170 response elicited by face. In Experiment 2, both before and after training, Greeble adaptors did not affect the N170 response elicited by faces. It is important to note that after training, the faces decreased the N170 response elicited by the Greebles. Conclusions: These results suggest that not only is there some commonality of N170 response elicited by face and nonface objects of expertise but also the kinds of functions associated with the N170 neural selectivity to faces were more than that to nonface expert objects.

Methods: Fourteen participants with AgCC (ages 11–59) completed the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (Brown \& Dunn, 2001). Sensory profile scales were classified as “Atypical” if they were more than 1 standard deviation from the mean. Results: Fifty-seven percent of participants with AgCC reported reduced sensory registration as compared to an expected 16\% of the normative sample. Similarly, 50\% of the AgCC participants reported atypically increased auditory processing difficulties. Conclusions: Using a well-established sensory processing questionnaire, participants with AgCC reported measurable differences in multiple aspects of sensory processing. The most notable difference was in the quadrant of low sensory registration, suggesting that individuals with AgCC may require sensory information to be presented more slowly or at a higher intensity for adequate processing. The sensory modality that was most affected was the auditory system, which is consistent with increased rates of language disorders and autism spectrum disorders in this population. Understanding sensory processing in individuals with AgCC can both elucidate the role of interhemispheric transfer in the development of intact sensory processing as well as contribute to our knowledge of the role of the corpus callosum in a range of disorders in which sensory processes are impacted.

	abstract = {Language learning requires that listeners discover acoustically variable functional units like phonetic categories and words from an unfamiliar, continuous acoustic stream. Although many category learning studies have examined how listeners learn to generalize across the acoustic variability inherent in the signals that convey the functional units of language, these studies have tended to focus upon category learning across isolated sound exemplars. However, continuous input presents many additional learning challenges that may impact category learning. Listeners may not know the timescale of the functional unit, its relative position in the continuous input, or its relationship to other evolving input regularities. Moving laboratory-based studies of isolated category exemplars toward more natural input is important to modeling language learning, but very little is known about how listeners discover categories embedded in continuous sound. In 3 experiments, adult participants heard acoustically variable sound category instances embedded in acoustically variable and unfamiliar sound streams within a video game task. This task was inherently rich in multisensory regularities with the to-be-learned categories and likely to engage procedural learning without requiring explicit categorization, segmentation, or even attention to the sounds. After 100 min of game play, participants categorized familiar sound streams in which target words were embedded and generalized this learning to novel streams as well as isolated instances of the target words. The findings demonstrate that even without a priori knowledge, listeners can discover input regularities that have the best predictive control over the environment for both non-native speech and nonspeech signals, emphasizing the generality of the learning.

In a series of experiments, we investigated implicit learning of the semantic preferences of novel verbs, specifically, whether they collocate with abstract or concrete nouns. After reading sentences containing the verbs, participants were required to judge the familiarity of pairs of novel verbs and nouns and to indicate their confidence or the basis of their judgment (i.e., guess, intuition, memory). Although all of the words had occurred in the texts, none of the critical items had actually occurred together. However, endorsement rates were significantly higher for pairs that respected the semantic preference rules than those that did not. Through analysis of subjective measures and verbal report, we argue that, for the majority of participants, this effect was based on unconscious knowledge. We argue that implicit learning of the kind of generalizations underlying semantic preferences is possible even after limited exposure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

It has been well established that in individual contexts, for transfer of learning to occur, participants need to practice an incompatible association between stimulus and response positions. The mechanisms underlying transfer of learning in joint task performance are, however, less well understood. The present study was aimed at assessing the relative contribution of 3 different spatial relations characterizing the joint practice context: stimulus-response, stimulus-participant, and participant-response relations. In 3 experiments, the authors manipulated the stimulus-response, stimulus-participant, and response-participant associations. We found that learning from the practice task did not transfer to the subsequent task when during practice stimulus–response associations were spatially incompatible and stimulus-participant associations were compatible (Experiment 1). However, a transfer of learning was evident when stimulus-participant associations were spatially incompatible. This occurred both when response-participant associations were incompatible (Experiment 2) and when they were compatible (Experiment 3). These results seem to support an agent corepresentation account of correspondence effects emerging in joint settings since they suggest that, in social contexts, critical to obtain transfer-of-learning effects is the spatial relation between stimulus and participant positions while the spatial relation between stimulus and response positions is irrelevant.

This phenomenon, termed the talker-variability effect (TVE), was recently reexamined by Hughes, Marsh, and Jones (2009, 2011), who used the effect as confirmatory evidence for their perceptual-gestural account of serial recall performance. Despite the authors’ claim of generalisability, the serial recall paradigm employed did not reflect the standard parameters more generally adopted in verbal short-term memory research. Specifically, the presentation rate of the stimuli was almost 3 times that typically used. We sought to determine if the TVE, as observed by Hughes et al., was generalisable to the standard serial recall task by directly comparing recall performance in talker-variable conditions at fast and slow stimulus presentation rates. Experiment 1 employed a systematic replication of the foundational study undertaken by Hughes et al. (2009). Utilising a novel stimulus set, Experiment 2 provided a subsequent test of the generalisability of the TVE, examining the influence of item properties. Both experiments showed a robust TVE at the atypical fast presentation rate; however, for the slower item presentation, the TVE was unreliable. Furthermore, error analysis suggests that item recall also contributes to the TVE, contrary to the current explanation proposed by Hughes et al. (2009, 2011). The challenge of the present data to the perceptual-gestural account of the TVE is explored. Alternative accounts that focus on the resource cost of categorical speech perception in the context of talker variability are posited. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Co-design is a method to include multiple perspectives, build trust, and share resources and power with community organizations and members. Materials and methods: The University of Maryland Prevention Research Center and Horowitz Center for Health Literacy activated established relationships with a national network of organizations serving LGBTQ+ populations and a state network of local health improvement coalitions to support COVID-19 vaccination messaging and behavioral nudges in plain language and primary languages. This paper describes the co-design process and customized COVID-19 vaccination products for the partners. Results: The process helped to build partner communication capacity and rapidly develop customized COVID-19 vaccination products for partner networks. We sustained relationships with both partner networks and actively worked together on developing messages and materials during the project's 12 months. Partner organizations reported high satisfaction with the co-design process and a wide range of communication materials with many unique nudges. Discussion and conclusions: Our project contributes to the public health co-design literature in 2 ways. Our project had robust evaluation throughout, which responds to the call for more evaluation of co-design effectiveness. We also show the combined usefulness of communication expertise and co-design, even under emergency conditions. Co-designing communication products can be time-consuming, but we were able to iterate, collect and apply feedback, and respond to partner requests on short notice. The communication expertise of the academic team allowed the communication material and nudge development to be high-quality and well-tailored for the intended audiences. Our project suggests that a well-executed co-design project should be paired with a robust, ongoing dissemination and staffing infrastructure to ensure products reach into communities. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Intervening in customer green behaviors is an important strategy for restaurants and hotels committed to environmental practices. Recent research has shifted from traditional interventions to nudging strategies. Emojis, as a visual language capable of conveying emotions or semantics, are highly popular on social media. However, current studies have scarcely addressed whether emojis can serve as a nudging strategy to enhance consumers’ green behavior. Based on this, our research investigates the nudging role of emojis in restaurant environmental messages through the visual priming effect. The study found through three experiments that: (1) emojis in restaurant environmental tip options significantly increase customers’ green behavior intentions; (2) feelings of elevation and guilt mediate this effect; (3) the importance of environmental values significantly moderates the impact. This research contributes to the literature on emojis and green behaviors, offering practical insights for the hospitality industry's environmental practices. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Language can be learned effectively, and students can become independent learners provided the strategies used for language teaching are based on cognitive and linguistic aspects. When the cognitive aspects of language are taken into account and students' unconscious mental processes, such as pattern identification and habit formation, are fostered, intuitive knowledge is created that supports language acquisition. The application of specific cognitive and metacognitive methods can aid language learners in becoming proficient readers and speakers. When the appropriate tactics are consistently employed, a second or foreign language learner's intuition develops, which promotes efficient language acquisition. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the cognitive and metacognitive strategies employed by learners worldwide to facilitate their acquisition of English as a second language, with a particular emphasis on speaking and reading. The present review selected twelve studies spanning 2012-2023, whereby six studies were based on strategies used for reading skills and six were based on strategies used for speaking skills. This review is significant as it highlights the different cognitive and metacognitive strategies preferred by learners to learn reading and speaking skills. It also shows the lack of information that students have about such strategies and also how the use of strategies depends on factors like the proficiency levels of the students and also the way they have been informed about those strategies by the teachers. © 2026, Pritha Mukhopadhyay, Sharmistha Banerjee and Ishita U.

	abstract = {Purpose: Effective self-management is key for older adults with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI) to maintain their health, safety, and independence. Self-regulation is one method of promoting self-management. However, it is essential to examine effective methods of self-regulation interventions to maxi-mize the use of such health promotion. Method: Forty-one older adults (19 with TBI; 22 without TBI) participated in an in-person or telepractice health education intervention for fall prevention with 15 speech-language pathology student clinicians. The intervention was a self-regulation strategy, mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII), for promoting fall prevention. This mixed methods study explored treatment adherence and evaluated implementation outcomes through acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, modifications to treatment, and therapist adherence and client participation. Results: All participants demonstrated some behavior change. Participants without TBI evaluated the MCII protocol as more acceptable, F(1, 39) = 5.88, p =.018; appropriate, F(1, 39) = 5.34, p =.023; and feasible, F(1, 39) = 9.56, p =.003, than participants with TBI, although all ratings were perceived as neu-tral or positive. From clinician data, protocol adherence, F(1, 39) = 1.57, p=.22, and client participation, F(1, 39) = 0.10, p=.92, were similar across injury groups, but participants with TBI required more fidelity-consistent modifications to treatment, F(1, 39) = 6.88, p=.012. There were no differences between set-tings except that those in telepractice had more client participation, F(1, 39) = 21.02, p {\textless}.001. Clinicians felt MCII was equally appropriate for both groups in all settings, acceptability: F(1, 48) = 0.082, p =.78; appropriateness: F(1, 48) = 0.554, p =.46; feasibility: F(1, 48) = 0.197, p =.66. Conclusion: MCII may be a feasible tool to provide health education as it offers enough structure and individualization to be considered appropriate and rele-vant for older adults, and for novice clinicians to administer and modify as needed based on client needs. © 2025 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of open Pre-trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model registry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and challenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional software dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the current state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are plagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions and inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on current PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods approach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model registry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM releases, with 40.87\% of changes to model weight files not represented in the adopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we identified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base models (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with Fine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods applied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in terms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still exist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we identified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and minor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of changes that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor version numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide valuable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards more formal semantic versioning practices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

	abstract = {Aim: To explore frail older adults' preferences and needs regarding mobile health (mHealth) exercise interventions in China. Additionally, it sought to identify the nudge strategies necessary for initiating and sustaining exercise behaviours among frail older adults. Design: A qualitative study. Method: The semi-structured interviews were conducted between April and May 2024 from two communities in Changsha, China. The data were analysed using a deductive framework analysis aligned to nudge theory, and an inductive thematic analysis to gather relevant needs and preferences. Results: This study involved 14 participants with pre-frailty or frailty, aged 60–82 years (median age of 64 years). While participants were generally receptive to new technologies, lower levels of health literacy and competing priorities often hindered their participation. Three primary functionality requirements were as follows. (1) Profession engagement: tailored exercise prescription, professional and timely feedback and guidance; (2) personalised knowledge encompassing pain management, successful cases and inspiration; (3) beneficial, tailored, dynamic, fragmented, challenging exercise courses. Participants showed positive attitudes towards simplification nudges, gamification nudges, social nudges, trustworthy nudges, reminder nudges, economic nudges, feedback nudges and pre-commitment nudges. Addressing privacy concerns was essential to build trust and acceptance among older adults. Conclusion: These findings emphasised the importance of designing mHealth interventions that address frail older adults' specific needs and preferences while incorporating effective nudge strategies to promote engagement and adherence. Future researchers should explore wearables, ChatGPT language models, virtual coaching assistants, exercise snack to further optimise the experience and analyse the effects of nudges in mHealth exercise interventions among older adults. Implication for the Profession and/or Patient Care: Exercise systems or app development for frail older adults should meet three basic functionality and essential nudge strategies. Reporting Method: The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines were used for reporting.

	abstract = {This review aimed to synthesize factors associated with medication nonadherence among people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D), using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model as the a priori model. Studies published between January 2014 and April 2024 were searched on five databases. Studies were included if they recruited PwT2D aged {\textgreater}18 years, investigated factors associated with adherence to oral and/or nonoral medications for diabetes, used qualitative research methods, were conducted in a community setting, were in English language and had accessible full-text articles. Best fit framework synthesis was undertaken, which led to the development of a hypothesized COM-B variant model specific to medication nonadherence among PwT2D. Study quality was assessed using published criteria to evaluate whether the study was adequately reported. Twenty-two studies were included. Factors were mapped onto the COM-B model: physical capability (e.g., difficulty injecting insulin independently), psychological capability (e.g., understanding about diabetes), physical opportunity (e.g., cost of medication), social opportunity (e.g., quality of communication and relationship with healthcare providers), automatic motivation (e.g., habit formation) and reflective motivation (e.g., perceived necessity and effectiveness of medications). Reflective motivation had the most themes, while physical capability only had one theme. Personality was a theme that could not be mapped onto the model. Interactions between some COM-B components (e.g., capability and motivation) were observed. This theoretically grounded synthesis may facilitate future intervention development by formulating a programme theory and identifying behaviour change techniques to address the identified factors. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Despite the ample benefits of physical activity (PA), many individuals do not meet the minimum PA recommended by health organizations. Structured questionnaires and interviews are commonly used to study why individuals perform PA and their strategies to adhere to PA. However, certain biases are inherent to these tools that limit what can be concluded from their results. Collecting data from social media channels can complement these studies and provide a more comprehensive overview of PA motives and adherence strategies. Objective: This study aims to investigate motives for engaging in PA, as well as the associated strategies to achieve these goals, as stated by a large number of people on a social media site. Methods: We searched for users’ responses regarding PA motives and adherence strategies in Reddit forums dedicated to PA and analyzed the data using (1) unsupervised clustering to identify topics from the textual comments and (2) supervised classification to classify the comments into the detected topics. A panel of experts participated in both steps for annotation and validation purposes. Results: We analyzed 1577 unique user comments (representing 1577 individual users); of those, 1247 were linked to physical appearance (mentioned in 298/1247, 23.9\% of the comments) and improving physical (235/1247, 18.9\%) and mental health (211/1247, 16.9\%), indicating these as the main motivational factors. The main strategies people used to adhere to PA were habit formation (373/1247, 30\%), goal setting (173/1247, 13.9\%), enjoyable activities (151/1247, 12.1\%), socializing (121/1247, 9.7\%), using media (111/1247, 8.9\%), using different apps to monitor PA (35/1247, 2.8\%), and financial commitment (32/1247, 2.5\%). Conclusions: This study presented a novel approach using a language model to investigate why people engage in PA and the strategies they use to adhere to PA using wide-scale, self-disclosed content from popular social media channels. ©Michal Shmueli-Scheuer, Yedidya Silverman, Israel Halperin, Yftach Gepner.},

Materials and Methods: In the ongoing International Diabetes Management Practices Study, we collected patient-reported outcomes data from structured questionnaires (chronic treatment acceptance questionnaire and Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire) and free-text answers to open-ended questions to assess perceptions of treatment value and side-effects, as well as barriers to, and enablers for, adherence and self-management. Free-text answers were analyzed by natural language processing. Results: In 2018–2020, we recruited 2,475 patients with type 2 diabetes (43.3\% insulin-treated, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 8.0 ± 1.8\%; 30.9\% with HbA1c {\textless}7\%) from 13 countries across Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and Asia. Mean ± standard deviation scores of chronic treatment acceptance questionnaire (acceptance of medication, rated out of 100) and Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (self-management, rated out of 10) were 87.8 ± 24.5 and 3.3 ± 0.9, respectively. Based on free-text analysis and coded responses, one in three patients reported treatment non-adherence. Overall, although most patients accepted treatment values and side-effects, self-management was suboptimal. Treatment duration, regimen complexity and disruption of daily routines were major barriers to adherence, whereas habit formation was a key enabler. Treatment-adherent patients were older (60 ± 11.6 vs 55 ± 11.7 years, P {\textless} 0.001), and more likely to have longer disease duration (12 ± 8.6 vs 10 ± 7.7 years, P {\textless} 0.001), exposure to diabetes education (73.1\% vs 67.8\%, P {\textless} 0.05), lower HbA1c (7.9 ± 1.8\% vs 8.3 ± 1.9\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and attainment of HbA1c {\textless}7\% (29.7\% vs 23.3\%, P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: Patient perceptions/experiences influence treatment adherence and self-management. Patient-centered education and support programs that consider patient-reported outcomes aimed at promoting empowerment and developing new routines might improve glycemic control. © 2024 The Authors.

This review identifies and evaluates patient-targeted nudges to support opioid tapering among adults with chronic non-cancer pain. Methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Social Science citation index for articles published from 2010 to January 2023. Eligibility criteria were based on the PICOS framework and included original peer-reviewed English language studies on adults with chronic non-cancer pain and interventions aligning with the nudge definition by Thaler and Sunstein. Studies with relevant comparators, measurable outcomes, real-world data, and pre/post-intervention measures were included. Data were manually extracted and reported in a descriptive manner. The process adhered to PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. Results: Four of 222 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All included nudges aimed at providing information to support decision-making and behavior change. Three nudge categories were identified: increasing salience, understanding mappings, and feedback. Outcome measures were program-related, focusing on perceptions, knowledge acquisition, engagement metrics, and psychological well-being. Conclusions: There were no statistically significant effects or only small evidence of effects in the program-related outcomes. None of the studies included a control group with standard care or no intervention comparison and none included objective measures of opioid reduction.

Such manifestation, however, lacks theoretical grounding and remains under researched due to two notable challenges: first, absence of conceptual underpinnings between consumers’ writing style and recommendation behavior. Second, little knowledge about the role of product characteristics underlying fake reviews and their influence on nudging product preferences. Through the lens of environmental psychology, this study uses an empirical investigation utilizing natural language processing (NLP) to uncover latent product-specific features underlying customer reviews and their impact on persuading buying preferences. As a major finding, we observe that characteristics underlying fake reviews, as opposed to genuine ones, fail to influence product recommendation or discouragement. Accordingly, we suggest firms permitting fake reviews on their portals to be aware of the limited economic advantages of such practices. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Objective: Health care overuse is pervasive in countries with advanced health care delivery systems. We hypothesize that effective interventions to reduce low-value care that targets patients or clinicians are mediated by psychological and cognitive processes that change behaviors and that interventions targeting these processes are varied. Thus, we performed a scoping review of experimental studies of interventions, including the interventions' objectives and characteristics, to reduce low-value care that targeted psychological and cognitive processes. Methods: We systematically searched databases for experimental studies of interventions to change cognitive orientations and affective states in the setting of health care overuse. Outcomes included observed overuse or a stated intention to use services. We used existing frameworks for behavior change and mechanisms of change to categorize the interventions and the mediating processes. Results: Twenty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen studied the provision of information to patients or clinicians, with most providing cost information. Six studies used educational interventions, including the provision of feedback about individual practice. Studies rarely used counseling, behavioral nudges, persuasion, and rewards. Mechanisms for behavior change included gain in knowledge or confidence and motivation by social norms. Conclusions: In this scoping review, we found few experiments testing interventions that directly target the psychological and cognitive processes of patients or clinicians to reduce low-value care. Most studies provided information to patients or clinicians without measuring or considering mediating factors toward behavior change. These findings highlight the need for process-driven experimental designs, including trials of behavioral nudges and persuasive language involving a trusting patient-clinician relationship, to identify effective interventions to reduce low-value care. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Objective: Most people with epilepsy (PWE) could live seizure-free if treated with one or more antiseizure medications (ASMs). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 75\% of PWE in low-resource settings lack adequate antiseizure treatment. Limited education surrounding epilepsy and the out-of-pocket costs of ASMs in particular pose barriers to managing epilepsy in resource-poor, low-income settings. The aim of this study is to implement and test a novel strategy to improve outcomes across the epilepsy care cascade marked by (1) retention in epilepsy care, (2) adherence to ASMs, and (3) seizure reduction, with the measured goal of seizure freedom. Methods: A randomized, double-blinded clinical trial will be performed, centered at the Ignace Deen Hospital in Conakry, Republic of Guinea, in Western Sub-Saharan Africa. Two hundred people with clinically diagnosed epilepsy, ages 18 years and above, will receive education on epilepsy and then be randomized to (i) free ASMs versus (ii) conditional cash, conditioned upon return to the epilepsy clinic. Participants will be followed for 360 days with study visits every 90 days following enrollment. Significance: We design a randomized trial for PWE in Guinea, a low-resource setting with a high proportion of untreated PWE and a nearly completely privatized healthcare system. The trial includes a conditional cash transfer intervention, which has yet to be tested as a targeted means to improve outcomes for people with a chronic neurological disorder. The trial aims to provide an evidence base for the treatment of epilepsy in such settings. Plain Language Summary: We present a clinical trial protocol for a randomized, blinded study of 200 people with epilepsy in the low-resource African Republic of Guinea, providing an educational intervention (E), and then randomizing in a 1:1 allocation to either free antiseizure medication (m) or conditional cash (c2) for 360 days. Measured outcomes include (1) returning to outpatient epilepsy care, (2) adherence to antiseizure medications (ASMs), and (3) reducing the number of seizures. This study is an initial look at giving small amounts of cash for desired results (or “nudges”) for improving epilepsy outcomes in the sub-Saharan African and brain disorder contexts. © 2023 The Authors.

Some societies-or better, polities-are more rigid, reliant on past practices to survive; some are more fluid and open to new possibilities. Each has proven vulnerable.

	abstract = {Background: Brief message interventions have demonstrated immense promise in health care, yet the development of these messages has suffered from a dearth of transparency and a scarcity of publicly accessible data sets. Moreover, the researcher-driven content creation process has raised resource allocation issues, necessitating a more efficient and transparent approach to content development. Objective: This research sets out to address the challenges of content development for SMS interventions by showcasing the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for content creation, transparently explaining the prompt design and content generation process, and providing the largest publicly available data set of brief messages and source code for future replication of our process. Methods: Leveraging the pretrained large language model GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), we generate a collection of messages in the context of medication adherence for individuals with type 2 diabetes using evidence-derived behavior change techniques identified in a prior systematic review. We create an attributed prompt designed to adhere to content (readability and tone) and SMS (character count and encoder type) standards while encouraging message variability to reflect differences in behavior change techniques. Results: We deliver the most extensive repository of brief messages for a singular health care intervention and the first library of messages crafted with generative AI. In total, our method yields a data set comprising 1150 messages, with 89.91\% (n=1034) meeting character length requirements and 80.7\% (n=928) meeting readability requirements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that all messages exhibit diversity comparable to an existing publicly available data set created under the same theoretical framework for a similar setting. Conclusions: This research provides a novel approach to content creation for health care interventions using state-of-the-art generative AI tools. Future research is needed to assess the generated content for ethical, safety, and research standards, as well as to determine whether the intervention is successful in improving the target behaviors. © Rachel M Harrison, Ekaterina Lapteva, Anton Bibin.

	abstract = {As part of an experimental research project led by Jana Norman and Emily Potter of Deakin University, Shadow Places, 1 inspired by work of Val Plumwood, we travelled 780 kilometres from Adelaide to the far west of South Australia, to Ceduna (pop. 3651), Penong (pop. 280) and Cactus Beach (no permanent population). Spending a few days there in early July 2023, with academics experimenting with creative modes of delivery, the aim was to create a link between these remote places and the metropolis, to find ways to think and feel differently about places that are ‘the underside of the capitalist fantasy, “the multiple disregarded places of economic and ecological support”' (Plumwood 2008, p. 139). These places, far from view and mind and sometimes out of sight but up close, are what, [Plumwood] says, we need to face and own, recognise and remember. These places are not outside ourselves, but implicated in the very constitution of our embodied, habitual and social lives. We differentially benefit from these places. (Potter et al. 2022, p. 286) The urgency of climate change and environmental issues has prompted the academics cited here to adopt a manifesto mode of delivery and to network more actively with community members in these shadow places. It is necessarily a collective kind of activity, aiming for sustainable connections rather than individual productivity. In the spirit of this collective production, two of us opted for a dialogic mode of inquiry: Prudence Since the late 1970s, Cactus has had a shadowy existence for me. I always knew about Cactus, even though I wasn’t a surfer. Stories coming back from people who had been there installed the place in my imagination in ways that people talk of as ‘legendary’. Looking at this photograph now (Figure 15.1) of this old surfers’ shack in Cactus materialises my imagination. There they are in close proximity to each other, and they are very close to the sea. They were a long way from Adelaide. Stephen Along with the ‘outback’ the beach is the most mythologised and romanticised space in Australian culture. 2 But are these two enjoying the remoteness and the proximity? What do these terms signify? Prudence It must be relative; Cactus is not remote if you feel you are present there. For the WiraŊu people, it always was, always is, home. Stephen That designation ‘remote’ is a way of asserting the metropolitan right to erase a place. The remote area is exploitable because nobody is supposed to be home. It is a shadow existence; not really real. Prudence Actually, proximity, it seems to me, is more important than difference. If you are close by to someone or something, why would you stress your difference from them, and thus feed the identity politics machine? Stephen Why indeed? Negotiating coexistence makes much more sense. With dolphins, for instance. Prudence With Coffin Bay oysters. Stephen With the north wind from the desert. Prudence With the reliable left-hand break. Stephen Nothing to do with difference; it’s all about being attached to such things. What you need to have rather than what you think you must be. Prudence All we need is an old Cactus shack. Stephen Now you are being nostalgic for something you never had. Nostalgia without an object. Prudence Actually, I preferred the campervan we travelled in, speaking of close proximity. I liked the way our bodies had to navigate the space - shifting, sliding, nudging and weaving. Let’s spin this out a bit. Can proximity be a kind of method in Cultural Studies? Stephen I think so. Difference was an orthodox theoretical concept from the 1980s (let me cite something from the website for the journal differences: ‘differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies first appeared in 1989 at the moment of a critical encounter - a head-on collision, one might say - of theories of difference (primarily Continental) and the politics of diversity (primarily American)'). Derrida’s influential différance meets US identity politics. Maybe it has run its course? Prudence The world has shrunk since then. ‘Interconnectedness’ and ‘entanglement’ are new catchphrases that are trying to grasp the vision of life on Earth where things depend on each other and are therefore more intimate with each other. It did feel intimate in the campervan. Stephen And that points to a new kind of reasoning. The old ethic, the Eurocentric one, was an expansive application of reason, Immanuel Kant’s sapere aude: ‘Dare to use your own understanding’. Isabelle Stengers glossed this: ‘[it] commits the children of the Enlightenment to behave as active subjects, wielding the weapon of reason’ (qtd in Pignarre 2023, pp. 142-143). She goes on to point out that sapere means ‘taste’ as well as ‘know’ (as in ‘savor’ and ‘savvy’). Sapere aude: ‘Dare to taste’. So the new kind of reasoning will be forged more by a slogan like, ‘Dare to let yourself be touched’ or ‘Dare to begin to understand otherwise’. Prudence Wait a minute. What on earth do you mean? That individual human reason is no longer the weapon of choice? I guess we are now thinking through more complex, affective, networks of relations with things. And non-humans have intelligence as well. But how does that help us do cultural studies in a place like Ceduna or Cactus? A cultural studies of proximity? Do we start by saying Ceduna and Cactus aren’t remote from us, in Adelaide? But hang on …. wasn’t that the draw of Cactus? That it was so far away? And isn’t it the distance that protects it from hordes of tourists? And isn’t it precisely because the instantaneous internet connections of social media bring it closer, that the managers of the Cactus campground have requested that people don’t post anything on Instagram? Stephen I think that is the dynamic we are exploring for possible analysis. If distance has been ingrained into Australian mythologies, we want to add proximity. Designations of ‘remote’ or ‘tyranny of distance’ cast places into shadows: too far away to matter, really. But once you start detailing the connections, things come suddenly closer. For instance, all the agricultural and mineral wealth pouring in from the Eyre Peninsula … that special short stalk species of wheat that is more suited to the dry conditions. Prudence Speaking of industry, that brings up two matters of concern we can conclude with. Remember Trina telling us the story of how she dressed in a seagull costume and walked to the Great Australian Bight to protest BPs plan to build off-shore fossil fuel extraction platforms? She has been living near Cactus for years, in a house that is ‘off the grid’. It was her backyard they threatened to spoil. Proximity made it really matter for her. Stephen I know. The other story we heard all about was the nuclear waste disposal idea for Kimba, some 300 kilometres away. The fight went on for years. It is so easy for people in the cities to be NIMBY. ‘Oh, no. Nuclear waste is far too dangerous to be buried anywhere near North Adelaide!' For the Kimba people, Kimba still wasn’t remote enough from the danger. The colonial idea of exporting your problems to someone else’s somewhere, while simultaneously importing the wealth gained from their lands … Prudence … hinges around designating them as remote. Stephen Whereas the very practice of bringing people into the conversation, like Sandy in Ceduna, who introduced us to Trina and others whose stories we heard, is all about understanding, negotiation, friendship, community and intimacy … I think our dialogue enacted that, at least a bit. It remains to conclude with a number of manifesto-like rhetorical ‘moves’ that feed into the transformations of the field of cultural studies as it struggles to think and feel about environmental crises: Move one: Stop using the adjective ‘remote’. Aboriginal groups like the WiraŊu, who have been at home there ‘since day one’ (as they like to put it), do not see themselves as ‘remote’ at all, while no doubt recognising the hegemonic view that services are delivered, and power and control exercised, by capital cities far to the east. But evocations of the ‘primitive’ have been traditionally been used as an economic strategy to hollow out a space for further exploitation. Such ‘representational rhetorics’ maintain a paradigm of oppositions: remote/settled, primitive/civilised, ancient/modern (West 2016). They work in parallel with, and facilitate, extraction industries because ‘remote’ is not only implies affective distance - it doesn’t matter to ‘us’ because it is too far away - but also that there is no one really at home. A rejection of remoteness returns us to considerations of the proximate. Move two: Ask what you are living off. Flying unnecessary stuff around the planet is a global logistical crisis. Kenneth Pomeranz called the mechanism for imperial wealth accumulation ‘ghost acreage’: in little Britain, the territory they lived on was not the territory they lived off (Latour \& Weibel 2020, p.15). Still today. You can live on a yacht in the Mediterranean if you can live off your shares in BHP, which was seeking to extract gas from the Great Australian Bight, near Ceduna. It is easy to moralise about living according to what one’s proximate territory can sustain. But how can one wind back economics of globalisation, so that it become more like an economics of what Bruno Latour calls ‘critical zones’? Move three (a militant move): In order to be absolutely clear, we put this in vernacular language: Don’t let them get away with it. Because the modus vivendi of the neo-liberal order is ‘whatever we can get away with’. But away to where? Stash the cash in an off-shore account? Proximity might imply a restraint on the freedoms associated with accumulation. We have to find a way to trick them into thinking there are all kinds of advantages, some of them economic, associated with proximity. But ‘they’, those leading the world with their immense wealth, are under the spell of a story, a techno-futurist colonisation story; they think it makes sense to fly off to Mars. Move four: Recraft the story, in order to recompose the commons. Russell West-Pavlov writes in the Introduction to this volume of a ‘matrix for potential co-existences’. And Vinciane Despret came up with a writing method, which can certainly contribute to ‘proximity-as-method’. As she embarks on an investigation into accounts of posthumous existences, someone tells her a story, and she writes: What do I do with this? What meanings are soliciting me? What kind of becoming can I offer this? It is a matter not of explaining but of understanding in the literal sense [com-prendre = ‘to take with’]. Allowing oneself to be instructed. Making a narrative matrix out of a story. It is a machine for making stories that go step by step; a matrix of stories that are constructed out of the preceding ones, and, as they do this, the one connects with the other, not on a thread, but in the way that a web is made. This is what we might call writing in three dimensions. Any point of the frame can give birth to a new narrative direction. (Despret 2021, p. 17) This ‘matrix for potential co-existences’ may not need a theory to explain or justify it. There are empirical connections ‘on the ground’, as it were. They are not simply existences, because they are also attachments. This is the starting point for our version of proximity-as-method. We suggest embarking on a description of what some entity has to have in order to persist, and that will mean describing it in all its heterogenous relationships. An ‘entity’ - a dolphin, a surfing break, a campervan, a human body - is already a bundle of relations, some proximate, some more remote. In the critical zones in which entities have evolved and in which they coexist with others, these relations shift and change, expand and contract, in ways we have yet to explore further. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Riccarda Flemmer, Bani Gill, and Jacky Kosgei; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {Objectives Low-value care can harm patients and healthcare systems. Despite a decade of global endeavours, low value care has persisted. Identification of barriers and enablers is essential for effective deimplementation of low-value care. This scoping review is an evidence summary of barriers, enablers and features of effective interventions for deimplementation of low-value care in emergency medicine practice worldwide. Design A mixed-methods scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Data sources Medline, CINAHL, Embase, EMCare, Scopus and grey literature were searched from inception to 5 December 2022. Eligibility criteria Primary studies which employed qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods approaches to explore deimplementation of low-value care in an EM setting and reported barriers, enablers or interventions were included. Reviews, protocols, perspectives, comments, opinions, editorials, letters to editors, news articles, books, chapters, policies, guidelines and animal studies were excluded. No language limits were applied. Data extraction and synthesis Study selection, data collection and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Barriers, enablers and interventions were mapped to the domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used for quality assessment. Results The search yielded 167 studies. A majority were quantitative studies (90\%, 150/167) that evaluated interventions (86\%, 143/167). Limited provider abilities, diagnostic uncertainty, lack of provider insight, time constraints, fear of litigation, and patient expectations were the key barriers. Enablers included leadership commitment, provider engagement, provider training, performance feedback to providers and shared decision-making with patients. Interventions included one or more of the following facets: education, stakeholder engagement, audit and feedback, clinical decision support, nudge, clinical champions and training. Multifaceted interventions were more likely to be effective than single-faceted interventions. Effectiveness of multifaceted interventions was influenced by fidelity of the intervention facets. Use of behavioural change theories such as the Theoretical Domains Framework in the published studies appeared to enhance the effectiveness of interventions to deimplement low-value care. Conclusion High-fidelity, multifaceted interventions that incorporated education, stakeholder engagement, audit/feedback and clinical decision support, were administered daily and lasted longer than 1 year were most effective in achieving deimplementation of low-value care in emergency departments. This review contributes the best available evidence to date, but further rigorous, theory-informed, qualitative and mixed-methods studies are needed to supplement the growing body of evidence to effectively deimplement low-value care in emergency medicine practice.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

In the present experiment (N=827), we investigated whether news media can improve diverse political listening in the United States via a reduction in party cue salience. Although Republican (Democratic) participants showed a strong preference for listening to speeches given by Republican (Democratic) politicians when party cues were highly salient, this bias in selective political listening was reduced or even absent when news items provided no or only low-salience cues. Conditional process analysis indicated that (automatically activated) implicit and (overtly expressed) explicit party attitudes mediated this effect. There are important implications: Current journalism practices tend to exacerbate tribal us-vs-them thinking by emphasizing partisan cues, nudging citizens toward not listening to political ideas from the other political camp.

Survey responses were collected from 701 Korean L2 English teachers and were analyzed with exploratory factor analyses and logistic regressions. This study found four major findings, irrespective of the level of teachers’ prior experience with research-related activities. First, there was a marked discrepancy between teachers’ grammar instruction and pedagogical recommendations of form-focused instruction studies. Second, in-class environment was the most influential element in shaping their grammar instruction. Third, more research-related activities in the past did not lead to noticeable research engagement in the present. Fourth, lack of external support was the biggest hindrance to teachers’ research engagement to implement evidence-based grammar instruction. However, prior research-related experience appeared to nudge teachers into acknowledging the value of research while also causing them to be more cognizant of the limited relevance of research to their grammar teaching practice. I argue that the irrelevance of research can be a more serious obstacle to teachers’ research engagement in the long term and L2 pedagogy literacy of researchers is a prerequisite for research-informed pedagogy to be achievable. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Cognitive reappraisal is a widely utilized emotion regulation strategy that involves altering the personal meaning of an emotional event to enhance attention to emotional responses. Despite its common use, individual differences in cognitive reappraisal techniques and the spontaneous recovery, renewal, and reinstatement of negative responses across varying contexts may limit its effectiveness. Furthermore, detached reappraisal could cause distress for clients. According to Gross’s theory, cognitive reappraisal is an effortless process that can occur spontaneously. When guided language triggers cognitive reappraisal as an emotion regulation strategy in laboratory or counseling settings, clients experience improved emotional states, but this induced strategy may not necessarily guide them in regulating emotions in similar future situations. Therefore, effectively applying cognitive reappraisal techniques in clinical practice to help clients alleviate emotional distress in daily life remains a significant concern. Exploring the mechanism of cognitive reappraisal reveals that reconstructing stimulus meaning is akin to extinction learning, which entails fostering cognitive contingency that the original stimulus provoking negative emotions will no longer result in negative outcomes in the current context. However, extinction learning is a new learning process rather than an elimination process. The activation of new learning relies on the presentation of critical cues, with contextual cues often playing a vital role, such as a safe laboratory or consulting room environment. We propose a new understanding of cognitive reappraisal based on the schema theory and the dual-system theory, emphasizing the significance of environmental interaction and feedback in constructing new experiences and updating schemata. This approach ultimately enriches the schema during training and integrates the new schema into long-term memory. Bottom-up behavioral experiences as schema enrichment training provide the foundation for top-down regulation to function. This method can assist clients in activating more suitable schemata probabilistically when encountering stimuli in real life, forming stable emotions, and achieving transfer and application across diverse contexts.

The framework leverages the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Persuasion Theory to promote secure behaviours through targeted interventions such as education, training, gamification, security tips, reminders, and nudges. ChatGPT can provide personalized and interactive training on information security best practices, deliver relevant threat alerts and tips, and assist with security assessments. Gamification can be used to increase engagement and retention of information security knowledge. The use of nudges and reminders can help sustain secure behaviours over time. Overall, the ChatGPT framework offers a promising approach for organizations looking to enhance their cybersecurity posture by promoting a culture of information security and empowering individuals with the knowledge and tools to protect sensitive information. The framework was then validated by prompting ChatGPT to raise awareness.

It spotlights ethical, moral, and philosophical underpinnings of the practice of behavioral nudging and what these issues portend for the future as technology and consumer psychology advance. Comparative points of the individual contributors are discussed by the editors which provides insight on the advantages as well as risks of using algorithmic nudging via communication channels. Integrating the major themes of philosophy and praxis, the editors combine insights from the individual chapters. Drawing attention to the importance of having an overarching architectonic at both the moral and procedural levels, the editors contend that having such a framework will be necessary to foster an intellectual climate that protects human autonomy. Their argument has particular pertinence as the power of artificial intelligence (AI) seeps ever deeper into societal structures. The theme of concern about the seemingly unlimited power of nudging by often imperceptible levels of control is magnified by AI. Outstanding examples of just how intimate nudging can become are the ever-proliferating uses of chatbots and large language models such as ChatGPT. As people use these machine learning technologies, behavioral data can be accumulated that touches on every aspect of life. Thus an enduring challenge remains how to encourage and direct beneficial technological innovations while also protecting individual autonomy and preventing exploitation. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {This erratum describes changes made in our previously published study protocol [1], as the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to insurmountable challenges in feasibility to maintain the original design. The planned start of participant recruitment for the trial coincided with the first COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands starting March 16 2020. As a result, the start of the study was postponed by 11 months. The continued/renewed lockdown hampered face-to-face contact and thus some planned physical measurements. These circumstances required adaptation to remote data collection methods, revision of recruitment goals and of the primary study outcomes, and inclusion of additional study sites to secure adequate participant inclusion rates. Therefore, below we present the revised methodology of the Supreme Nudge parallel cluster-randomised controlled supermarket trial. All changes made to the original protocol were reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of VU University Medical Center (reference number: 2019.334) prior to implementation. Study design As previously described [1], the Supreme Nudge supermarket trial is a cluster randomised controlled design, with nudging and pricing strategies implemented at the supermarket level (Fig. 1). The original protocol described two groups of intervention supermarkets (nudging or nudging and pricing) and one group of control supermarkets. This design is revised to two groups in total; supermarkets are randomized to an intervention group receiving the combination of healthy food nudges and pricing strategies or a control group receiving no intervention. The groups for the mobile physical activity (PA) coaching app remain unchanged; the coaching app is randomised at the individual level across all supermarket clusters. The original protocol described inclusion of eight supermarkets and an intervention duration and followup time of 12 months [1]. However, recruitment among eight supermarkets led to insufficient participant enrolment, which necessitated additional inclusion of four additional supermarket locations. As a result, eight out of 12 supermarkets were enrolled within the study in the spring of 2021 and the four additional supermarket locations in the autumn of 2021. For these four stores, the intervention implementation and the follow-up time is only feasible for a duration of six months due to ending of project funding by the summer of 2022. Supermarkets Twelve supermarkets of a Dutch supermarket chain that meet all of the following criteria are included in the study: i) Regular supermarket format, i.e., no compact store size (unchanged criterion); ii) Located in a lower SEP neighbourhood (below average postal code SEP-scores of The Netherlands Institute for Social Research [2]) (unchanged criterion); iii) Implemented a new cash register system which allowed implementation of pricing strategies (new criterion). Participants Participants are men and women living in a low SEP neighbourhood. Used inclusion criteria are: i) Aged 30–80 years (was 45–75 years in the original protocol); ii) Living in a lower SEP neighbourhood surrounding one of the participating supermarkets (was combined with having a practical vocational education level in the original protocol); iii) Self-report to do (or report their partner does) more than half of the household grocery shopping at the selected supermarket and plan to continue visiting for the next (half) year (unchanged criterion); iv) Provide written informed consent (unchanged criterion); v) Able to communicate in the Dutch language (unchanged criterion). Trial outcomes We revised our primary outcomes to changes in the dietary intake (DHD15-index scores [3]) over 6 or 12 months for all intervention supermarket participants compared to control participants. Secondary outcomes now include cardiometabolic outcomes, including HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), TC/ HDL-ratio, triglycerides (TG) and waist circumference. The planned blood pressure measurement was excluded due to feasibility limitations when we needed to adapt to remote data collecting methods. Regarding the other previously described secondary outcomes, some questionnaire items relating to walking behaviours and social cognitive factors have been revised. Furthermore, we added healthy dietary intake per food group based on the sub-scores of the DHD15-index scores [3], items on selfreported walking behaviour, use of the coaching app and walking app, privacy concerns relating to the coaching app and on perceptions on healthy eating and on grocery shopping (described in detail below). Sample size The current set-up of the trial is powered to detect a mean change of 5 points on the DHD15-index, assuming a 15 point standard deviation of the mean change. This standard deviation is based on the first round of collected baseline data in the spring of 2021, where the standard deviation of the DHD15-index score was 19.9. To estimate a standard deviation around the mean difference, we used the formula σ √[2(1-ρ)], assuming a ρ of 0.75, resulting in a standard deviation of the mean difference of 14.1. With 80\% power and a two-sided type 1 error rate of 0.05, the trial required 141 participants in each supermarket arm. To allow for 25\% drop out, a minimum of 176 participants need to be recruited per arm, resulting in 352 participants in total. We set our recruitment goal at 360 participants, resulting in a mean of 30 participants per cluster (i.e., supermarket). We did not use a design factor, as our estimations based on our first round of baseline data showed no correlation for observations of DHD15-index scores between study sites. Recruitment As planned, a stepwise recruitment strategy was applied. However, active recruitment possibilities were limited due to the COVID-19 lockdown and planned neighbourhood tailored community-outreach methods and active recruitment at local events were not possible. As alternative active recruitment method participants were requested via a phone call to encourage their partner or neighbours to register for eligibility screening (promoting word-of-mouth). Recruiting in-store by the research team was conducted as soon as COVID-19 related restrictions allowed, which started approximately halfway through the recruitment period. Furthermore, additional passive recruitment strategies were applied throughout the whole recruitment period. The initial planned passive strategies started with local advertisements including news articles in local (online) media, flyers distributed in the supermarket and by mail, posters displayed in-store and at some other locations in the neighbourhood (e.g., physiotherapy practice), postal invitation letters sent to every household of the municipality around the included supermarkets, and municipality targeted Facebook advertisements. The additional passive strategies were an email invitation to the supermarket’s customer panels, Facebook posts on the participating supermarket pages, and advertisement on the website of the Dutch Heart Foundation (study funder). Study procedures All data collection procedures are adapted towards remote data collection methods, instead of inviting participants to a study location. The eligibility screening and inclusion procedure was as follows: Interested supermarket customers registered via the project website, by telephone, or mailing a register form which was included on the supermarket flyer. Next, they received an online screening questionnaire including all items regarding the inclusion and exclusions criteria. Those who appeared eligible based on the screening received a mail with participant information form and consent from and a free of charge reply envelope. Researchers called all eligible participants two or three days after sending the information form to elaborate on potential participation and to provide the opportunity the ask questions. Next, eligible participants were invited to sign the consent form and return it in the return envelope. Baseline data collection started as soon as the researchers received the completed consent form. Participants were sent an email explaining study procedures regarding the at-home-measurement kit for the cardiometabolic measurements, the online questionnaires, instructions for the use of a supermarket loyalty card, and, if applicable, instructions for downloading and installation of the step counter app and the coaching app. Instructions referenced a web-based step-by-step guide with pictures, including a video showing the same steps. On the same day of sending this email explaining study procedures, the at-home-measurement kit was sent to the participants home address by mail. The kit consisted of a blood test and a waist circumferences measuring tape, including an instruction letter referencing a web-based instruction video. Four to seven days after sending the athome- measurement kit, participants received two webbased questionnaires. The first questionnaire asked about lifestyle factors and provided opportunity to fill in the results from the at-home waist circumference measurement. The second questionnaire concerned questions on the dietary intake (DHD15-index). Participants not using email received the questionnaires via mail, including a free of charge return envelope. Collected data Table 1 presents an updated version of the study time line and included measurements and changes in collected data and questionnaire items are detailed below. The blood test measures lipid profile and HbA1c concentrations using a finger prick, collecting capillary blood into two small capillary tubes which are sent back to the lab via a medical reply envelope in the mail. Blood samples are collected non-fasted by the participant at home, or if desired by the participant with help from trained research staff during a home visit. Four blood drops are obtained with a single finger prick for the HbA1c test tube, and 16 blood drips for the lipid test tube. Participants are instructed to put their blood sample back in the package designed for medical postal service and ship the test at day of collection. When the outside temperature is {\textless}4 or {\textgreater} 25 degrees of Celsius, the participant is instructed to drop the package at a postal office. Blood samples collected via the at-home measurement kit are analysed by the Amsterdam UMC – VUmc clinical laboratory. HbA1c in the whole blood remains stable at room temperature and the at-home-measurement via the finger prick test of HbA1c is therefore a standard procedure used in the hospital. However, the at-home-measurement of blood lipids was not a standard procedure at study conception. Therefore, the stability of the lipid profile in whole blood kept at room temperature was pilot tested by the laboratory prior to the study. Tubes partly prefilled with heparin were used to secure preservation of the sample for blood plasma analysis. The pilot test was conducted by leaving ten blood samples at room temperature for seven days. Up to day three, the absolute mean change in LDL was deemed acceptable (15\% change) as compared to the samples directly analysed at day zero (Table 2). All blood test results were analysed by enzymatic colorimetric test via the Roche/Hitachi Cobas C systems. The lipid test directly measures total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides (TG). Based on these measurements, the TC/HDL-ratio and the LDL-cholesterol value was calculated following the Friedewald equation. During the baseline measurements, 89\% of blood samples were analysed at day 1 after collection, confirming the feasibility of this procedure. Table 3 shows a revised version of all questionnaire items related to secondary outcomes. We have added items relating to perceptions on healthy eating, perceptions during grocery shopping, walking behaviours and social cognitive factors, self-reported walking behaviour and privacy concerns relating to the coaching app. Regarding covariates measured, we have added a question whether participants have been pregnant in the past year considering the waist circumference measurement. Statistical analysis Population baseline characteristics will be described stratified by trial arm, to examine adequate balance between intervention groups and to provide an overview of the study population. Baseline differences between intervention groups will be visually inspected to detect potential clinically relevant differences. Baseline characteristics will be summarised as mean and standard deviation for normally distributed continuous variables, and median and interquartile range for skewed continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages will be presented for each category of categorical variables. Collected data on the DHD15-index scores will be treated as continuous outcome variables. To investigate intervention effects a multilevel analysis (i.e. linear mixed models) will be applied. Analyses will be based on individual participant data, with a random intercept at the subject level and potentially including a random slope for supermarket location. The outcome model will be adjusted for the baseline value in order to take into account the regression to the mean phenomenon. Changes in the secondary outcomes, including all cardiometabolic outcomes, the percentage of healthy food purchase, food decision styles, social cognitive factors, perceptions, and customer satisfaction, will all be treated as continuous outcome variables and analysed following a similar procedure as described at the multilevel analysis for the primary outcome. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic (and its aftermath) highlights a critical need to communicate health information effectively to the global public. Given that subtle differences in information framing can have meaningful effects on behavior, behavioral science research highlights a pressing question: Is it more effective to frame COVID-19 health messages in terms of potential losses (e.g., “If you do not practice these steps, you can endanger yourself and others”) or potential gains (e.g., “If you practice these steps, you can protect yourself and others”)? Collecting data in 48 languages from 15,929 participants in 84 countries, we experimentally tested the effects of message framing on COVID-19-related judgments, intentions, and feelings. Loss- (vs. gain-) framed messages increased self-reported anxiety among participants cross-nationally with little-to-no impact on policy attitudes, behavioral intentions, or information seeking relevant to pandemic risks. These results were consistent across 84 countries, three variations of the message framing wording, and 560 data processing and analytic choices. Thus, results provide an empirical answer to a global communication question and highlight the emotional toll of loss-framed messages. Critically, this work demonstrates the importance of considering unintended affective consequences when evaluating nudge-style interventions. © 2022, The Society for Affective Science.},

	abstract = {Understanding why some migrants in Europe are at risk of underimmunisation and show lower vaccination uptake for routine and COVID-19 vaccines is critical if we are to address vaccination inequities and meet the goals of WHO's new Immunisation Agenda 2030. We did a systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020219214) exploring barriers and facilitators of vaccine uptake (categorised using the 5As taxonomy: access, awareness, affordability, acceptance, activation) and sociodemographic determinants of undervaccination among migrants in the EU and European Economic Area, the UK, and Switzerland. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from 2000 to 2021 for primary research, with no restrictions on language. 5259 data sources were screened, with 67 studies included from 16 countries, representing 366 529 migrants. We identified multiple access barriers—including language, literacy, and communication barriers, practical and legal barriers to accessing and delivering vaccination services, and service barriers such as lack of specific guidelines and knowledge of health-care professionals—for key vaccines including measles-mumps-rubella, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, human papillomavirus, influenza, polio, and COVID-19 vaccines. Acceptance barriers were mostly reported in eastern European and Muslim migrants for human papillomavirus, measles, and influenza vaccines. We identified 23 significant determinants of undervaccination in migrants (p{\textless}0·05), including African origin, recent migration, and being a refugee or asylum seeker. We did not identify a strong overall association with gender or age. Tailored vaccination messaging, community outreach, and behavioural nudges facilitated uptake. Migrants' barriers to accessing health care are already well documented, and this Review confirms their role in limiting vaccine uptake. These findings hold immediate relevance to strengthening vaccination programmes in high-income countries, including for COVID-19, and suggest that tailored, culturally sensitive, and evidence-informed strategies, unambiguous public health messaging, and health system strengthening are needed to address access and acceptance barriers to vaccination in migrants and create opportunities and pathways for offering catch-up vaccinations to migrants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Objective: To incorporate user-centered design processes into the refinement of nudges designed to reduce no-shows among healthcare appointments for military veterans in the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Methods: We developed candidate nudges as brief messages based on four broad concepts in behavioral science. We then conducted iterative waves of multi-stage interviews (N = 27) that included a pile sorting task, a “think-aloud” review of each message, and prototype letter reviews. Rapid consensus analysis of each wave's feedback iteratively refined message language. Results: Veterans rejected several theoretically plausible messages focusing on avoiding the burden of rescheduling missed appointments or the monetary cost of no-shows. Participants suggested framing calling to cancel an appointment as helping other veterans and emphasized a new motivational theme: expressing personal concern for the veteran. Conclusion: Use of iterative UCD methods allowed for early identification of both messages inappropriate for veterans and new veteran-generated nudges around non-judgmental validation that could be incorporated in the design of our pragmatic trial. Practice implications: Rapid team-based qualitative analysis, iterative material design, and space in the study design to incorporate entirely new insights from participants into study materials are all approaches that can improve communications of what matters most to a specific population. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The availability of large pre-trained models is changing the landscape of Machine Learning research and practice, moving from a “training from scratch” to a “fine-tuning” paradigm. While in some applications the goal is to “nudge” the pre-trained distribution towards preferred outputs, in others it is to steer it towards a different distribution over the sample space. Two main paradigms have emerged to tackle this challenge: Reward Maximization (RM) and, more recently, Distribution Matching (DM). RM applies standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, such as Policy Gradients, to gradually increase the reward signal. DM prescribes to first make explicit the target distribution that the model is fine-tuned to approximate. Here we explore the theoretical connections between the two paradigms, and show that methods such as KL-control developed for RM can also be construed as belonging to DM. We further observe that while DM differs from RM, it can suffer from similar training difficulties, such as high gradient variance. We leverage connections between the two paradigms to import the concept of baseline into DM methods. We empirically validate the benefits of adding a baseline on an array of controllable language generation tasks such as constraining topic, sentiment, and gender distributions in texts sampled from a language model. We observe superior performance in terms of constraint satisfaction, stability and sample efficiency. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation. All rights reserved.},

	title = {{MEMORY} {AUGMENTED} {OPTIMIZERS} {FOR} {DEEP} {LEARNING}},
	abstract = {Popular approaches for minimizing loss in data-driven learning often involve an abstraction or an explicit retention of the history of gradients for efficient parameter updates. The aggregated history of gradients nudges the parameter updates in the right direction even when the gradients at any given step are not informative. Although the history of gradients summarized in meta-parameters or explicitly stored in memory has been shown effective in theory and practice, the question of whether all or only a subset of the gradients in the history are sufficient in deciding the parameter updates remains unanswered. In this paper, we propose a framework of memory-augmented gradient descent optimizers that retain a limited view of their gradient history in their internal memory. Such optimizers scale well to large real-life datasets, and our experiments show that the memory augmented extensions of standard optimizers enjoy accelerated convergence and improved performance on a majority of computer vision and language tasks that we considered. Additionally, we prove that the proposed class of optimizers with fixed-size memory converge under assumptions of strong convexity, regardless of which gradients are selected or how they are linearly combined to form the update step. © 2022 ICLR 2022 - 10th International Conference on Learning Representationss.

Text messaging may impact medication refill behavior and can be delivered at scale to patients by texting mobile phones. To obtain feedback from persons with chronic conditions on the design of interactive text messages and determine language of message for making messages that can motivate patients to refill medications on time. We purposively sampled 35 English and Spanish speaking patients with at least one chronic condition from three large healthcare delivery systems to participate in N-of-1 video-based synchronous interviews. Research assistants shared ideas for theory-informed text messages with content intended to persuade patients to refill their medication. We transcribed recorded interviews and conducted a content analysis to identify strategies to employ generating a dynamic interactive text message library intended to increase medication refill. Those interviewed were of diverse age and race/ethnicity and typical of persons with multiple chronic conditions. Several participants emphasized that personally tailored and positively framed messages would be more persuasive than generic and/or negative messages. Some patients appreciated humor and messages that could evoke a sense of social support from their providers and rejected the use of emojis. Messages to remind patients to refill medications may facilitate improvements in adherence, which in turn can improve chronic care. Designing messages that are persuasive and can prompt action is feasible and should be considered given the ease with which such messages can be delivered automatically at scale.  © 2021 Society of Behavioral Medicine.

Focus groups with MU older adults and service providers were conducted to identify modifications. The new adapted program, Diverse Older Adults Doing LiFE (DO LiFE), was then evaluated with older adults. Thematic analysis revealed health literacy and lack of racial representation as barriers to implementing LIFE in this population. The pilot study showed that DO LiFE was feasible with good retention (89\%) and high adherence (81.27\%) rates. DO LiFE demonstrated preliminary feasibility for diverse MU older adults.

	issn = {1465-1858},
	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD013705.pub2},
	abstract = {Background: Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection could contribute to clinical and public health strategies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Point-of-care antigen and molecular tests to detect current infection could increase access to testing and early confirmation of cases, and expediate clinical and public health management decisions that may reduce transmission. Objectives: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups. Search methods: Electronic searches of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) were undertaken on 30 Sept 2020. We checked repositories of COVID-19 publications and included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and the Diagnostics Global Health website to 16 Nov 2020. We did not apply language restrictions. Selection criteria: We included studies of people with either suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, known SARS-CoV-2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen or molecular tests suitable for a point-of-care setting (minimal equipment, sample preparation, and biosafety requirements, with results within two hours of sample collection). We included all reference standards that define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and established diagnostic criteria). Data collection and analysis: Studies were screened independently in duplicate with disagreements resolved by discussion with a third author. Study characteristics were extracted by one author and checked by a second; extraction of study results and assessments of risk of bias and applicability (made using the QUADAS-2 tool) were undertaken independently in duplicate. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test and pooled data using the bivariate model separately for antigen and molecular-based tests. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status. Main results: Seventy-eight study cohorts were included (described in 64 study reports, including 20 pre-prints), reporting results for 24,087 samples (7,415 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2). Studies were mainly from Europe (n = 39) or North America (n = 20), and evaluated 16 antigen and five molecular assays. We considered risk of bias to be high in 29 (37\%) studies because of participant selection; in 66 (85\%) because of weaknesses in the reference standard for absence of infection; and in 29 (37\%) for participant flow and timing. Studies of antigen tests were of a higher methodological quality compared to studies of molecular tests, particularly regarding the risk of bias for participant selection and the index test. Characteristics of participants in 35 (45\%) studies differed from those in whom the test was intended to be used and the delivery of the index test in 39 (50\%) studies differed from the way in which the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (97\%) defined the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 based on a single RT-PCR result, and none included participants meeting case definitions for probable COVID-19. Antigen tests. Forty-eight studies reported 58 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of sensitivity varied considerably between studies. There were differences between symptomatic (72.0\%, 95\% CI 63.7\% to 79.0\%; 37 evaluations; 15530 samples, 4410 cases) and asymptomatic participants (58.1\%, 95\% CI 40.2\% to 74.1\%; 12 evaluations; 1581 samples, 295 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the first week after symptom onset (78.3\%, 95\% CI 71.1\% to 84.1\%; 26 evaluations; 5769 samples, 2320 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (51.0\%, 95\% CI 40.8\% to 61.0\%; 22 evaluations; 935 samples, 692 cases). Sensitivity was high in those with cycle threshold (Ct) values on PCR ≤25 (94.5\%, 95\% CI 91.0\% to 96.7\%; 36 evaluations; 2613 cases) compared to those with Ct values {\textgreater}25 (40.7\%, 95\% CI 31.8\% to 50.3\%; 36 evaluations; 2632 cases). Sensitivity varied between brands. Using data from instructions for use (IFU) compliant evaluations in symptomatic participants, summary sensitivities ranged from 34.1\% (95\% CI 29.7\% to 38.8\%; Coris Bioconcept) to 88.1\% (95\% CI 84.2\% to 91.1\%; SD Biosensor STANDARD Q). Average specificities were high in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, and for most brands (overall summary specificity 99.6\%, 95\% CI 99.0\% to 99.8\%). At 5\% prevalence using data for the most sensitive assays in symptomatic people (SD Biosensor STANDARD Q and Abbott Panbio), positive predictive values (PPVs) of 84\% to 90\% mean that between 1 in 10 and 1 in 6 positive results will be a false positive, and between 1 in 4 and 1 in 8 cases will be missed. At 0.5\% prevalence applying the same tests in asymptomatic people would result in PPVs of 11\% to 28\% meaning that between 7 in 10 and 9 in 10 positive results will be false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed. No studies assessed the accuracy of repeated lateral flow testing or self-testing. Rapid molecular assays. Thirty studies reported 33 evaluations of five different rapid molecular tests. Sensitivities varied according to test brand. Most of the data relate to the ID NOW and Xpert Xpress assays. Using data from evaluations following the manufacturer’s instructions for use, the average sensitivity of ID NOW was 73.0\% (95\% CI 66.8\% to 78.4\%) and average specificity 99.7\% (95\% CI 98.7\% to 99.9\%; 4 evaluations; 812 samples, 222 cases). For Xpert Xpress, the average sensitivity was 100\% (95\% CI 88.1\% to 100\%) and average specificity 97.2\% (95\% CI 89.4\% to 99.3\%; 2 evaluations; 100 samples, 29 cases). Insufficient data were available to investigate the effect of symptom status or time after symptom onset. Authors' conclusions: Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness when viral loads are higher. The assays shown to meet appropriate criteria, such as WHO's priority target product profiles for COVID-19 diagnostics (‘acceptable’ sensitivity ≥ 80\% and specificity ≥ 97\%), can be considered as a replacement for laboratory-based RT-PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be made, or where RT-PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. Positive predictive values suggest that confirmatory testing of those with positive results may be considered in low prevalence settings. Due to the variable sensitivity of antigen tests, people who test negative may still be infected. Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts was limited. Test accuracy studies cannot adequately assess the ability of antigen tests to differentiate those who are infectious and require isolation from those who pose no risk, as there is no reference standard for infectiousness. A small number of molecular tests showed high accuracy and may be suitable alternatives to RT-PCR. However, further evaluations of the tests in settings as they are intended to be used are required to fully establish performance in practice. Several important studies in asymptomatic individuals have been reported since the close of our search and will be incorporated at the next update of this review. Comparative studies of antigen tests in their intended use settings and according to test operator (including self-testing) are required. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Social norms messaging campaigns are increasingly used to influence human behavior, with social science research generally finding that they have modest but meaningful effects. One aspect of these campaigns in practice has been the inclusion of injunctive norms messaging, designed to convey a social judgment about one's behavior (often in the form of encouraging or discouraging language, or a visual smiley or frowny face). While some prominent research has provided support for the use of such messaging as a tool for positive behavior change, causal evidence on the effect of injunctive norms messaging as a motivator (as opposed to just one part of a multifaceted messaging campaign) is limited. This paper presents a field experiment on water conservation behavior conducted by an organization in California, involving over 40,000 households, which provides some of the most precise evidence to date regarding the effect of injunctive norms on decision making. I find that not only do injunctive norms encourage conservation behavior, there is also no evidence that they discourage individuals from further attending to norms messaging–regardless of whether the social judgment conveyed is negative or positive. Taken together, this suggests that injunctive norms are a useful tool in “nudge”-style campaigns tackling behavior change. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	volume = {13},
	issn = {2161-7201},
	doi = {10.1093/jla/laaa006},
	abstract = {Dark patterns are user interfaces whose designers knowingly confuse users, make it difficult for users to express their actual preferences, or manipulate users into taking certain actions. They typically exploit cognitive biases and prompt online consumers to purchase goods and services that they do not want or to reveal personal information they would prefer not to disclose. This article provides the first public evidence of the power of dark patterns. It discusses the results of the authors' two large-scale experiments in which representative samples of American consumers were exposed to dark patterns. In the first study, users exposed to mild dark patterns were more than twice as likely to sign up for a dubious service as those assigned to the control group, and users in the aggressive dark pattern condition were almost four times as likely to subscribe. Moreover, whereas aggressive dark patterns generated a powerful backlash among consumers, mild dark patterns did not. Less educated subjects were significantly more susceptible to mild dark patterns than their well-educated counterparts. The second study identified the dark patterns that seem most likely to nudge consumers into making decisions that they are likely to regret or misunderstand. Hidden information, trick question, and obstruction strategies were particularly likely to manipulate consumers successfully. Other strategies employing loaded language or generating bandwagon effects worked moderately well, while still others such as "must act now"messages did not make consumers more likely to purchase a costly service. Our second study also replicated a striking result in the first experiment, which is that where dark patterns were employed the cost of the service offered to consumers became immaterial. Decision architecture, not price, drove consumer purchasing decisions. The article concludes by examining legal frameworks for addressing dark patterns. Many dark patterns appear to violate federal and state laws restricting the use of unfair and deceptive practices in trade. Moreover, in those instances where consumers enter into contracts after being exposed to dark patterns, their consent could be deemed voidable under contract law principles. The article also proposes that dark pattern audits become part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s consent decree process. Dark patterns are presumably proliferating because firms' proprietary A-B testing has revealed them to be profit maximizing. We show how similar A-B testing can be used to identify those dark patterns that are so manipulative that they ought to be deemed unlawful. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {The majority of research on learning a non-native language has focused on the personal benefits of being bilingual or multilingual. In this paper, we focus on the potential positive effect of actively thinking in a non-native language. Our approach is inspired by recent experimental research suggesting that actively thinking in a non-native language leads to improved reasoning and decision-making, which is known as the foreign-language effect (FLE). We examine the possibility that one could choose to think in a non-native language in order to reap these potential benefits. Integrating this research with research in positive psychology, we explain how doing so might be understood as a type of “nudge,” or intervention that one could use to increase their chances of making autonomous decisions reflecting their own best interest. Nudges have been associated with improved outcomes with respect to many aspects of our lives – for instance sticking to goals, saving money, exercising more frequently, maintaining a healthy diet. It may be that bilinguals can assume an active role in increasing their happiness or well-being by making better decisions through strategic implementation of a non-native language in decision-making contexts. We also discuss the ethics of using the FLE as a nudge when it has beneficial consequences, as there are instances when doing so could be beneficial with respect to public policy as well. For instance, it has been shown that people are less averse to sustainable farming and eating practices (e.g., eating insects) when actively thinking in a non-native language. After reviewing the current research on the FLE, we suggest that further research needs to be done because actively thinking in a non-native language seems to function beneficially in some circumstances but may pose cognitive disadvantages in others. © Copyright © 2020 McFarlane, Cipolletti Perez and Weissglass.},

However, little research has examined the emerging occupations arising to carry out the data work necessary to produce “improved” data sets, or the specific work activities of these emerging data occupations. We describe the work of Clinical Documentation Integrity Specialists (CDIS), an emerging occupation that focuses on improving clinical documentation to produce more detailed and accurate administrative datasets crucial for evolving data-intensive forms of healthcare accountability, management, and research. Using ethnographic methods, we describe the core of CDIS’ work as a translation practice in which the language, interests, and concerns of clinicians and clinical documentation are translated via real-time “nudging” and ongoing education of clinicians into the language, interests, and concerns of medical coders, structured administrative datasets, and the various stakeholders of these datasets. Further, we show how the institutional context of CDIS’ work shapes the occupational virtues that guide CDIS’ translation practice, including financial reimbursement, quality measures, clinical accuracy, and protecting clinician’s time. Despite the existence of these multiple virtues, financial reimbursement is the most prominent virtue guiding CDIS’ limited attention. Thus, overall clinical documentation is “improved” in specific, partial ways. This research provides one of the first studies of the emergent data work occupations arising in the wake of digitization and big data opportunities, and shows how local data settings shape large scale data in specific ways and thus may influence outcomes of analyses based on such data. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Background: The long-term management of cardiometabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension, is complex and can be facilitated by supporting patient-directed behavioral changes. The concurrent application of wireless technology and personalized text messages (PTMs) based on behavioral economics in managing cardiometabolic diseases, although promising, has not been studied. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the concurrent application of wireless home blood pressure (BP) monitoring (as an example of "automated hovering") and PTMs (as an example of "nudging") targeting pharmacotherapy and lifestyle habits in patients with cardiometabolic disease (type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension). Methods: The Wireless Technology and Behavioral Economics to Engage Patients (WiBEEP) with cardiometabolic disease study was a single-arm, open-label, 7-week-long pilot study in 12 patients (mean age 58.5 years) with access to a mobile phone. The study took place at Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA) between March and September 2017. All patients received PTMs; nine patients received wireless home BP monitoring. At baseline, patients completed questionnaires to learn about their health goals and to assess medication adherence; at the end of week 7, all patients completed questionnaires to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and assess medication adherence. Hemoglobin A1c was ascertained from data collected during routine clinical care in 7 patients with available data. Results: The majority of patients reported the text messages to be easy to understand (88\%) and appropriate in frequency (71\%) and language (88\%). All patients reported BP monitoring to be useful. Mean arterial pressure was lower at the end-of-study compared to baseline (- 3.4mmHg [95\% CI, - 5 to - 1.8]. Mean change in hemoglobin A1c was - 0.31\% [95\% CI, - 0.56 to - 0.06]. Conclusions: Among patients with cardiometabolic disease, the combination of wireless BP monitoring and lifestylefocused text messaging was feasible and acceptable. Larger studies will determine the long-term effectiveness of such an approach. © The Author(s).},

Historically the principles underpinning evidence-based practice apply across all branches of health care and over the past 20 years great steps have been taken in the treatment of children with developmental language disorder (DLD) and in the field of speech and language science more generally to use evidence to inform practice. Here we look at what we understand by evidence-based practice and its component parts and ask how easy it really is to integrate such disparate sources of information. We then turn to the broader educational context in which practices, whether evidence-based or otherwise, are implemented in educational policy and ask what role overarching professional bodies have in co-ordinating, directing or simply nudging practice across Europe.

	abstract = {The formation of healthy habits is considered to play a fundamental role in health behavior change. A variety of studies on Health Behavior Change Support Systems (HBCSS) have been conducted recently, in which individuals use such systems to influence their own attitudes or behaviors to achieve their personal goals. However, comparatively much less research has been devoted to studying how the users of these systems form habits with the help of HBCSS, or to understanding how to design these systems to support habit formation. Objective: The objective of this article is to study HBCSS user experiences regarding habit formation through an intervention study targeted at establishing a healthier lifestyle. This study also aims to map habit formation stages, as suggested by Lally and Gardner, with the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model. The application domain is the prevention of metabolic syndrome, in which 5\% weight loss can significantly reduce the prevalence of the syndrome. Methods: This study employs a web-based HBCSS named Onnikka, a lifestyle intervention designed for the prevention of metabolic syndrome for participants who are at risk of developing a metabolic syndrome or are already suffering from it. The system under investigation was designed according to the principles of the PSD model and Behavior Change Support System framework. Lally and Gardner's research on the stages of habit formation were used to study the extent to which the Onnikka system was able to enhance the development of new habits. A total of 43 Onnikka users were interviewed for this study during and after a 52-week intervention period. The research approach employed here was hermeneutics, which leans ontologically toward the social construction of reality, gained through language, consciousness, and shared meaning. In addition, the system's login data and participants’ weight measurements were utilized to build an interpretation of the results. Results: The findings of this study suggest that IT habits appear to have a strong linkage with use adherence, whereas lifestyle habits did not seem to be directly related to the 5\% weight loss among study participants. Moreover, habit formation stages provide a possible explanation for why self-monitoring, reminders, and tunneling were perceived as especially valuable features in this study. Conclusions: For sustainable weight management, holistic e-health interventions are required, and the PSD model offers a practical approach for designing and developing them. Recognizing the stages of habit formation provides additional valuable guidance for designing systems that help shape an individual's habits. © 2018},

Therefore, pregnancy may be the best opportunity to disrupt the generational cycle of obesity. More than half of women in the UK now enter pregnancy overweight or obese, highlighting that if interventions are not targeted towards women in higher weight categories before conception they are likely to ‘miss the mark’. To address issues of suboptimal maternal nutrition and excessive GWG in antenatal care, health professionals need to consider how women’s requirements and expectations may have changed in recent years and the impact of weight stigma on the care of women who are obese. This paper aims to drive changes in clinical practice guidelines, medical curricula, the language used by health professionals, and ultimately promote maternal nutrition and weight management in pregnancy as key priorities during antenatal care. Evidence indicates that women want non-judgemental, simple and encouraging guidance in these areas. Small changes to health professionals’ practice can improve how advice regarding nutrition and weight management in pregnancy is delivered, and has the potential to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence in women and their children in the years to come.

	abstract = {'Repetition' in language practice has often been associated with behavioristic drills, typically regarded as giving rise to habit formation, and often excluded from mainstream language teaching approaches. However, this study, drawing upon Bygate's (1999) argument that task is a context for the framing and reframing of language, shows that repetition in meaningful tasks does not necessarily involve passive performance repetition; instead, L2 learners are actively re-constructing the narrative discourse. This study provides support to this argument through the analysis of the speech samples from thirteen learners performing an immediate exact L2 task repetition. The participants were asked to perform a video-based monologue story narration twice to an imagined listener, and the comparison of the learners' first and second speech performances shows that the learners enhanced their discourse performance with: (1) increased quantity of discourse (evidenced by more Total Words, Total Propositions, and higher P-density); (2) increased cohesion (evidenced by higher ratio of given words to new words in sentences based on latent semantic analysis, i.e., LSA Given/New value); and (3) increased quality of lexis (evidenced by higher Noun Hyperonymy value, indicating more specific nouns used). The results suggest that task repetition, in addition to its effects on language complexity, accuracy, and fluency, has an impact on learners' speech performance at the discourse level. © 2018 John Benjamins Publishing Company},

	abstract = {Background: The National Health Service Health Check (NHS HC) is a population level public health programme. It is a primary prevention initiative offering cardiovascular risk assessment and management for adults aged 40-74 years (every five years). It was designed to reduce the incidence of major vascular disease events by preventing or delaying the onset of diabetes, heart and kidney disease, stroke and vascular dementia. Effectiveness of the programme has been modelled on a national uptake of 75 \% however in 2012/13 uptake, nationally, was 49 \%. Ensuring a high percentage of those offered an NHS HC actually receive one is key to optimising the clinical and cost effectiveness of the programme. Methods: A pragmatic quasi-randomised controlled trial was conducted in four general practitioner practices in Medway, England with randomisation of 3511 patients. The aim was to compare attendance at the NHS HC using the standard national invitation template letter (control) compared to an enhanced invitation letter using insights from behavioural science (intervention). The intervention letter includes i) simplification - reducing letter content for less effortful processing ii) behavioural instruction - action focused language iii) personal salience - appointment due rather than invited and iv) addressing implementation intentions with a tear off slip to record the date, time and location of the appointment. Logistic Regression explored the association between control and intervention group and attendance at a health check. Results: 29.3 \% of patients who received the control letter and 33.5 \% of those who received the intervention letter attended their NHS HC (adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95 \% confidence interval 1.09-1.47, p {\textless} 0.01). This was an absolute difference in uptake of 4.2 percentage points for those receiving the intervention letter. Conclusions: An invitation letter applying behavioural insights was more effective than the existing national template letter at encouraging attendance at an NHS HC. Making small, no cost behaviourally informed changes to letter invitations can improve uptake of the NHS HC. Further research is required to replicate the effect with more robust methodology and powered for sub-group analysis including socio-economic status.

Outcomes of interest included adherence, goal pursuit and physical health outcomes. Methods: Keywords were used to search electronic databases without date or language restrictions (up to 30 April 2014). Studies were included if they (1) concerned a patient population; (2) used if-then plans as a sole intervention or as part of treatment, therapy or rehabilitation; (3) if they were randomised controlled trials. The PEDro scale was used to evaluate study quality. Guidance as set out by the Cochrane Collaboration was used. Two reviewers independently extracted data, discrepancies were discussed and if required referred to a third reviewer. Results: In total, 18 of the 2141 articles were identified as potentially relevant and four studies of people with epilepsy, chronic back pain, stroke and obesity met the inclusion criteria. People who form if-then plans achieved better outcomes on epilepsy and stroke medication adherence and physical capacity than controls. Conclusions: Of the four studies that used an if-then plan, only one (people with epilepsy) looked at the intervention as a stand-alone strategy. Further research needs to explore if this simple approach improves rehabilitation outcomes and is a helpful and feasible strategy for people experiencing disabilities.Implications for RehabilitationSteps involved in achieving goals, such as doing exercises or completing other goal related tasks, can be compromised for people with chronic health conditions particularly resulting from difficulties in self-regulating behaviour.If-then plans are implementation intention tools aimed at supporting people to deal more effectively with self-regulatory problems that might undermine goal striving and goal attainment, and have been found to be effective in health promotion and health behaviour change.This systematic literature review identified four studies completed with patient populations, with three demonstrating effectiveness.If-then plans provide an opportunity for clinicians to develop better ways of implementing rehabilitation. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

	abstract = {And the logical method and form flatter that longing for certainty and for repose which is in every human mind. But certainty generally is illusion, and repose is not the destiny of man. Behind the logical form lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legislative grounds … the very root and nerve of the whole proceeding. Law and economics have a history. There have been periods of admiration, flirting and courtship, leading to happy marriages and a bunch of children with names such as torts, antitrust, and banking regulation. There have also been language problems, misunderstandings, and passionate fights about who wears the pants, resulting in the law having affairs with dangerous strangers such as Ronald Dworkin. Today, we seem to be witnessing an aging couple, pottering about in harmony, the fights of the past long forgotten. All they quarrel about nowadays is economics’ newfound hobby involving a lot of mathematics which the law doesn't understand. May we, then, safely assume that they have agreed on what life is about and how to tackle its challenges? Are they speaking a common language? It is claimed in this chapter that this is not the case. The argument put forward here concerns a practice I will call “economic transplants”. The term denotes the process of identifying components of economic theory and integrating them in a legal argument. We have seen substantial collaboration along those lines for a long time. It has been especially popular in financial markets law, where theories such as the efficient capital markets hypothesis, the market for control theory or the capital asset pricing model have had a direct impact not only on legal scholarship, but also on legislators and consequently on the judiciary. Having lost some of their appeal after the financial crisis, behavioural economics approaches have sparked new interest in legal scholars, delivering a new type of “economic transplants”. Household finance regulation provides interesting examples of those, making use of their insights for coping with investor's shortcomings via enhanced information or “nudging” techniques. © Cambridge University Press 2015.},

This study examines how crosslinguistic influence impacts L2 learners’ acquisition and processing of Korean quotative constructions at the syntax-semantics-pragmatics interface. Using offline acceptability judgment and online self-paced reading tasks, we compared Japanese- and Chinese-speaking learners of Korean. The results revealed that Japanese-speaking learners outperformed Chinese-speaking learners in offline tasks, demonstrating native-like sensitivity to case-marking constraints, likely due to the structural similarities between Japanese and Korean. However, neither learner group exhibited sensitivity to case-marking violations during real-time processing, unlike native Korean speakers. These findings suggest a dissociation between explicit knowledge and online processing abilities, supporting the IH and emphasizing the persistent challenges of integrating multiple linguistic domains in L2 processing. This study underscores the role of crosslinguistic influence in facilitating explicit knowledge acquisition while revealing its limitations in fostering native-like automaticity in online processing. © The Author(s), 2025.

Cognitive fluency was operationalised as automaticity of lexical access (measured by rapid word recognition) and attention control (measured by the Stroop task). The tasks were conducted in both L1 (Finnish) and L2 (English) to examine the (dis)similarity of processing in the two languages. Speech rate in a monologue task was used as the dependent measure of speaking performance. The results showed that after controlling for the L1 speech rate and L1 cognitive fluency, the L2 attention control measures explained a small amount of additional variance in L2 speech rate.

Behavioral evidence has shown that listeners can identify better the voices of their native language than those of a non-native language, which is known as the language familiarity effect (LFE). However, its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study therefore investigated how the LFE occurs at the neural level by employing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Late unbalanced bilinguals were first asked to learn to associate strangers' voices with their identities and then tested for recognizing the talkers' identities based on their voices speaking a language either highly familiar (i.e., native language Chinese), or moderately familiar (i.e., second language English), or completely unfamiliar (i.e., Ewe) to participants. Participants identified talkers the most accurately in Chinese and the least accurately in Ewe. Talker identification was quicker in Chinese than in English and Ewe but reaction time did not differ between the two non-native languages. At the neural level, recognizing voices speaking Chinese relative to English/Ewe produced less activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, precentral/postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and superior temporal sulcus/gyrus while no difference was found between English and Ewe, indicating facilitation of voice identification by the automatic phonological encoding in the native language. These findings shed new light on the interrelations between language ability and voice recognition, revealing that the brain activation pattern of the LFE depends on the automaticity of language processing. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the contribution of L-SS integration during nonalphabetic native and alphabetic second language (L2) reading remains unclear. This study explored whether L-SS integration plays a similar role in a nonalphabetic language as in alphabetic languages and its contribution to L2 reading among native Japanese-speaking adults with varying English proficiency. A priming paradigm in Japanese and English was performed by presenting visual letters or symbols, followed by auditory sounds. We compared behavioral and event-related responses elicited by congruent letter–sound pairs, incongruent pairs, and baseline condition (symbol–sound pairs). The behavioral experiment revealed shorter RTs in the congruent condition for Japanese and English tasks, suggesting a facilitation effect of congruency. The ERP experiment results showed an increased early N1 response to Japanese congruent pairs compared to corresponding incongruent stimuli at the left frontotemporal electrodes. Interestingly, advanced English learners exhibited greater activities in bilateral but predominantly right-lateralized frontotemporal regions for the congruent condition within the N1 time window. Moreover, the enhancement of P2 response to congruent pairs was observed in intermediate English learners. These findings indicate that, despite deviations from native language processing, advanced speakers may successfully integrate letters and sounds during English reading, whereas intermediate learners may encounter difficulty in achieving L-SS integrationwhen reading L2. Furthermore, our results suggest that L2 proficiency may affect the level of automaticity in L-SS integration, with the right P2 congruency effect playing a compensatory role for intermediate learners. © 2024 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

In this study, we examined flow through the perspectives of the individuals experiencing it, by asking them to describe any insights relevant to their experience. During four weeks, five undergraduate students taking L2 French or Spanish coursework reported their flow states in weekly diary entries and interviews. Students described a total of 15 flow states, reporting them most frequently in interaction inside and outside coursework (e.g. speaking to a friend/stranger, in a paired task) but also while taking an exam, studying grammatical forms, listening to a lecture, reading, and practicing a speech. Qualitative coding revealed seven dimensions of flow, where five previously reported dimensions (attention, interest, enjoyment, sense of accomplishment, skill–challenge balance) were supported and clarified through our analyses while the remaining two (oblivion, stress) were identified for the first time. Flow appeared to be linked to proceduralisation of L2 skills, as the element of automaticity was prominent in most descriptions of flow. © 2023 Association for Language Learning.},

This study also explored the phrasal frequency effect on the relationship between collocational processing speed and UF to test whether the processing speed of higher-frequency collocations is more strongly related to UF. A total of 108 Japanese university students completed a phrasal acceptability judgment task with adjective-noun collocations pooled from the Academic Collocation List. Speech was elicited in an argumentative speech task, and UF measures were computed based on speed, breakdown, and repair fluency. The results revealed that the collocational processing speed was weakly tied to articulation rate and mid-clause and end-clause silent pause ratio (rho = {\textbar}.271-.322{\textbar}), while the collocational processing accuracy was weakly to moderately tied to most UF measures except filled pause ratio (rho = {\textbar}.281-.368{\textbar}). The collocation frequency moderated the relationship between the processing speed and UF, suggesting that high-frequency collocations served as a proxy for automaticity in speech production.

However, the extent to which elicited imitation tasks (EITs) draw on implicit or/and explicit knowledge has been a subject of controversy, due in part to the limitations of behavioral methods. To overcome this drawback, in this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural circuits underlying explicit and implicit knowledge (i.e., declarative and procedural memory) during the listening and speaking phases of an EIT performed by advanced L2 speakers of Japanese living in Japan. While the behavioral data suggest that the EIT primarily draws on automatized (speeded-up) explicit knowledge, the neuroimaging data revealed learners’ dynamic use of explicit and implicit knowledge during its comprehension and production phases. Higher explicit knowledge scores (derived from a metalinguistic knowledge task) were associated with greater declarative memory (left hippocampus) activation during the speaking EIT phase, indicating a prominent role of explicit knowledge in production. During the listening phase, however, higher explicit knowledge scores predicted lower activation in declarative memory (left hippocampus) and higher activation in procedural memory (left inferior frontal gyrus), suggesting that explicit knowledge plays both inhibitory and facilitative role in the use of implicit knowledge for comprehension. Taken together, these findings suggest that advanced L2 speakers utilize their explicit and implicit knowledge efficiently and dynamically—characterized as a hallmark of automaticity—for comprehension and production during the EIT. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Introduction: Although many countries have diverse populations and bilingual students, most handwriting research focused on monolingual students, and the issue of cross-linguistic transfer gained less attention. Moreover, research on the effect of socio-linguistic factors on cross-linguistic transfer of handwriting is scarce. This study compared handwriting performance of fourth-grade students attending bilingual schools, who wrote in their primary (L1) to second (L2) languages, and the effect of socio-linguistic factors on the transfer of handwriting performance. Method: Ninety-five typically developing fourth-grade students were recruited from three bilingual (Hebrew-Arabic) schools in Israel. Participants were administered a paper-pencil motor coordination task as well as reading and handwriting tests in their L1 and L2. Results: Transfer effect was not uniform and was stronger among the Arabic-speaking group. Reading speed and handwriting automaticity in L2 and handwriting speed in L1 predicted 70\% of the variance in L2 handwriting speed. Conclusion: These findings may be explained by the complexity of Arabic orthography, as well as the low level of exposure of the Hebrew-speaking students to Arabic, which is a minority language. These results can guide occupational therapists in addressing factors affecting handwriting difficulties, and in considering socio-linguistic factors necessary for mastering handwriting in teaching a second language. © The Author(s) 2022.},

This study aims to replicate the benefits of interleaved practice on the proceduralization of second language (L2) syntax and further examines the role of working memory (WM) in different practice schedules. Sixty English learners studied five types of relative-clause constructions under either blocked- or interleaved-practice conditions. The blocked-practice group engaged in systematic form-focused speaking practice with exemplars blocked by syntactic category, while the interleaved-practice group received mixed exemplars from the different categories. The proceduralization of grammatical knowledge was measured by analysing the accuracy and speed indices from a picture description test, which was administered immediately and one week after the training session. Learners’ WM capacity was measured using a listening-span task. Results showed that interleaved practice led to more accurate performance on both immediate and delayed posttests than blocked practice. The advantage of interleaved practice was less pronounced for the speed dimension of performance. Furthermore, interleaved practice facilitated skill development regardless of learners’ WM capacity, whereas in the blocked-practice condition, learners with higher WM capacity benefited more than those with lower WM capacity in speeding up of relative clause use, which presumably reflects the proceduralization–automatization stage. © The Author(s) 2020.},

Improvement was measured as the difference between the first and last practice sessions. The results showed that accuracy, speech rate, and pauses improved but with distinct patterns. Regression models showed that declarative knowledge did not predict accuracy or fluency; however, declarative knowledge assisted the learners to engage in targetlike behaviors at the initial stage of proceduralization.

The sample consisted of 123 native Arabic speaking fourth-grade students, of whom 64 attended monolingual schools, and 59 attended bilingual (Arabic–Hebrew) schools. We evaluated students’ Arabic handwriting speed and legibility as well as their handwriting automaticity, reading performance, motor control and non-verbal intelligence. Results showed that after controlling for reading speed, handwriting automaticity and motor control, the monolingual students outperformed their bilingual peers in handwriting speed but not in legibility. In addition, using hierarchical regression analysis, our results indicated that beyond the contribution of handwriting automaticity, reading speed and motor control, that explained 27\% of the variance in handwriting speed, the model of education of L2 (monolingual vs. bilingual schools) had a unique contribution, and explained an additional 2\% of students’ handwriting speed.

	abstract = {Research in second language (L2) task performance has been interested in examining fluency not only as a key aspect of language performance but also as a construct that can demonstrate L2 processing and development in concrete and measurable ways. Speech fluency has been particularly important in second language acquisition (SLA) research as it helps shed light on significant aspects of language processing, such as attention, noticing, and automaticity. This chapter will provide a brief overview of the literature on the relationship between automaticity and L2 fluency. It will then highlight the extent to which research in this area has moved beyond a simple and inadequately-defined concept of fluency to characterising fluency as a multidimensional and complex construct that is defined rigorously and measured objectively and systematically. After discussing the significance of fluency in language acquisition, language teaching and language assessment, the chapter evaluates the existing frameworks for defining and measuring fluency. It will also outline how operationalisation and measurement of fluency have changed to become more robust in nature and more methodical in operation. In doing so, Skehan’s influential contribution to the development of the current understanding of fluency and its measurement will be highlighted. The paper will conclude by underlining the need for expanding the existing framework to include other factors, such as individual, social, and cultural factors that affect fluency in task performance. © 2019 John Benjamins Publishing Company.},

Review of the past research on RR in L2 readers has inspired this current study, which aims at strengthening the effectiveness of RR within the L2 context. Hence, not only the automaticity of lower-level reading processing is tackled, but the repeated training on higher-level processing is also emphasized. EFL students with different English proficiencies were recruited to our RR intervention. It is hypothesized that by means of implicitly and repeatedly presenting different texts with similar text structure to the participants, they would "naturally" develop awareness of the text structure and show better reading comprehension. Participants' performance in pretest and posttest as well as during the intervention generally confirmed our prediction. Although the participants' reading fluency was not improved, their reading comprehension on new texts (transfer effect) did significantly improve. Additionally, the higher proficient EFL students also showed higher repetition and transfer effects during and after the intervention. Based on these findings, theoretical and practical implications for the future research on RR in L2 context are discussed.},

The chapter discusses that teachers need to have awareness of a range of such theoretical areas in order to understand and address the speaking needs of their students explicitly. It surveys some key areas of research that could enhance pedagogical knowledge. Linguistic knowledge encompasses structure, meaning, and use through four types of knowledge: phonological, grammatical, lexical, and discourse. Four broad categories of core speaking skills for proceduralization can be outlined: pronunciation, speech function, interaction management, and discourse organisation skills.

	abstract = {This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the brain regions underlying language task performance in adult second language (L2) learners. Specifically, we identified brain regions where the level of activation was associated with L2 fluency levels. Thirty Japanese-speaking adults participated in the study. All participants were L2 learners of English and had achieved varying levels of fluency, as determined by a standardized L2 English proficiency test, the Versant English Test (. Pearson Education Inc., 2011). When participants performed the oral sentence building task from the production tasks administered, the dorsal part of the left inferior frontal gyrus (dIFG) showed activation patterns that differed depending on the L2 fluency levels: The more fluent the participants were, the more dIFG activation decreased. This decreased activation of the dIFG might reflect the increased automaticity of a syntactic building process. In contrast, when participants performed an oral story comprehension task, the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) showed increased activation with higher fluency levels. This suggests that the learners with higher L2 fluency were actively engaged in post-syntactic integration processing supported by the left pSTG. These data imply that L2 fluency predicts neural resource allocation during language comprehension tasks as well as in production tasks. This study sheds light on the neural underpinnings of L2 learning by identifying the brain regions recruited during different language tasks across different modalities (production vs. comprehension). © 2015 The Authors.},

However, addressing spoken accuracy can be a daunting challenge for language teachers and students alike, as so much of what is done in the era of communicative language teaching is rooted in building confidence and fluency, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. Students thus often struggle to produce accurate grammatical, pronunciation, and discourse-style features. This chapter discusses how can accuracy be fostered, though, outside of a traditional ESL course. By using authentic materials and focusing on self-guided, project-based learning, students notice target structures and then practice them until they develop automaticity.

	abstract = {This study investigates how varying cognitive complexity levels of tasks and three predetermined task-sequence orders influence second language (L2) learners’ spoken performance within a technology-mediated task-based language teaching (TMTBLT) environment. Participants completed three monologic crime-reporting tasks, systematically designed to represent Simple, Middle, and Complex cognitive demands, presented in ascending, descending, or interleaved mixed sequences. Analysis focusing on syntactic complexity, lexical diversity, accuracy, and fluency demonstrated a partial inverted-U trend. Specifically, the Middle-level task frequently produced the most balanced complexity, accuracy, lexis, and fluency (CALF) profile across several linguistic dimensions, although this pattern was not consistently observed across all measures. In contrast, the Complex task typically enhanced accuracy but simultaneously constrained lexical diversity. Task sequencing exerted a noticeable effect primarily on fluency outcomes, with ascending sequences facilitating progressive fluency improvements over time. Conversely, beginning with the most challenging task initially diminished speaking speed but ultimately triggered notable recovery in fluency performance towards task completion. These findings lend empirical support to Robinson’s Cognition Hypothesis and Skehan’s attentional trade-off model, underscoring the potential for moderately challenging tasks, coupled with thoughtfully structured sequencing, to optimize oral proficiency development in technology-enhanced classroom contexts. Future research should incorporate a neutral baseline task and functional adequacy assessments to further elucidate these observed patterns and extend their generalizability. © 2025 by the author(s).

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study examines the effects of the mobile-assisted task-based language teaching (M-TBLT) approach on EFL learners’ oral production. It evaluates three key second language acquisition measures: complexity (syntactic and lexi-cal), accuracy (error-free clauses and correct verb forms), and fluency (unpruned and pruned speech rates). Additionally, it explores learners’ perceptions of the approach to gain deeper insights into its effectiveness. Background Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) provides a communicative framework but often faces challenges such as insufficient oral practice, delayed feedback, and limited authenticity. Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), with its flex-ibility and real-time interaction, offers potential solutions. However, empirical re-search integrating MALL with TBLT in oral English instruction remains scarce. This study introduces a structured six-step speaking instruction model to assess the impact of M-TBLT on learners' oral performance. Methodology A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design was employed. Par-ticipants were university students from two intact speaking classes in Hebei, China. The intervention incorporated two mobile applications—WeChat and Liulishuo—within a structured six-step speaking instruction model. Data collec-tion combined quantitative measures (pretest-posttest assessments) with qualita-tive insights from interviews and a teacher journal. Contribution This study fills a research gap by providing empirical evidence on the integration of mobile applications with TBLT in oral English instruction. Unlike existing studies that focus on spontaneous and unstructured speaking activities, this re-search integrates a well-sequenced instructional model. Findings contribute to both theoretical discussions and practical applications in mobile-assisted lan-guage learning. Findings Results indicate that M-TBLT significantly improved students’ speaking com-plexity (dependent clauses per T-unit), accuracy (error-free clauses and correct verb forms), and fluency (unpruned and pruned speech rates). However, no sig-nificant improvement was observed in lexical complexity (mean segmental type-token ratio). Qualitative findings reveal that participants had positive perceptions of M-TBLT, appreciating mobile affordances (ease of use, synchronous/asyn-chronous communication, repetition, instant feedback, and authenticity) and ed-ucational benefits (increased speaking practice and learning autonomy). Students particularly valued WeChat’s voice recording and group functions, as well as Liulishuo’s automatic speech recognition and shadowing features. Recommendations for Practitioners The structured speaking-instruction model offers educators a practical frame-work for implementing M-TBLT, enhancing both instructional design and stu-dents’ speaking performance. Recommendations for Researchers This study provides empirical support for M-TBLT in EFL settings. Researchers may explore its application in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts and exam-ine additional instructional variables. Impact on Society These findings benefit educators, researchers, and mobile technology developers, encouraging collaboration in advancing mobile-assisted task-based learning. Future Research Further research could investigate M-TBLT in varied learning environments, in-corporate additional performance measures, and assess new mobile-assisted speaking tools to enhance task-based learning.

	abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive review of the factors contributing to speaking anxiety among English learners and explores strategies to alleviate such anxiety. Speaking anxiety is identified as a major barrier to effective language acquisition, with learners often exhibiting moderate to high levels of anxiety when speaking. Contributing factors to this anxiety include low self-confidence, fear of negative evaluation, communication apprehension, and inadequate classroom management. Additionally, learners’ limited vocabulary, language proficiency, performance pressures, and cognitive and affective factors further exacerbate anxiety during speaking activities.The review emphasizes the importance of creating a supportive learning environment that encourages students to participate without fear of judgment. By fostering a classroom culture of respect and open communication, learners can feel more at ease while practicing their speaking skills. Gradual exposure to speaking tasks is another key strategy, where learners start with simpler, low-stakes activities and progressively tackle more complex tasks as their confidence grows. This step-by-step approach helps to reduce anxiety over time. Encouraging real-life practices, such as task-based learning or discussing everyday topics, further enhances the relevance of speaking tasks, allowing learners to connect language use with real-world situations. The use of technology also provides learners with low-pressure environments to practice and improve their speaking skills and offer opportunities for self-paced practice, contributing to a reduction in anxiety. This review highlights the significance of addressing speaking anxiety to improve English language learning outcomes. This review offers valuable insights for educators, researchers, and policymakers in developing targeted interventions to mitigate speaking anxiety and enhance speaking skills. By understanding the root causes and implementing effective strategies, language instructors can help learners overcome their fears, build communicative competence, and achieve long-term success in English language acquisition. © 2025, Malque Publishing.

The research employed a Research and Development (R\&D) design, using the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation). The worksheet was developed based on a needs analysis conducted with 22 students, following a Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) approach. Data collection methods included interviews and a questionnaire for the need analysis, experts’ validation questionnaires for worksheet evaluation, and a student’s perception questionnaire. The findings indicated that the designed English writing worksheet, which incorporates Islamic moderation values, consists of: 1) three units of writing materials, 2) five sub-units: ‘Let’s Get Ready’, ‘Let’s Practice’, ‘Grammar Focus’, ‘Let’s Do More’, and ‘Let’s Review’, 3) various task-based language teaching activities, 4) integration of Islamic moderation values, 5) an engaging layout and media, and 6) supplementary skills, including reading, listening, and speaking. The worksheet was tried out with the participants, and the results showed a mean score of 3.8 in the ‘excellent’ category based on student perceptions. The students’ interviews supported these findings. In conclusion, the English writing worksheet enhances writing skills and facilitates the practical application of Islamic moderation values in students’ daily lives. © 2025 by Authors, published by Studies in English Language and Education.},

Action research was used as the methodological framework through two iterative cycles (that is, two consecutive semesters) conducted with two mixed cohorts of heritage language learners and second language learners. Results highlighted the benefits of AR for bottom-up curriculum development and demonstrated significant gains in learners’ speaking and writing proficiency over time.

Students (around age 12 and at an A2 proficiency level) from three 7th grade classes interacted with five tasks and completed a questionnaire assessing their needs and perceptions. Results of the needs analysis revealed that most students speak some English outside of class and that they wish for tasks targeting both authentic and curricular needs. The interaction logs showed a strong preference for typing over speaking and moderate automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy for the spoken interactions. Differing rates of task success and interest between the five tasks confirmed the importance of task characteristics. Despite some noted limitations, student perceptions were largely positive, with the tasks appearing more fun and more challenging for students who speak less English outside of class. Overall, our findings highlight the promise and challenges of designing a task-based conversational agent for the school EFL classroom, offering insights into balancing pedagogical and technological design, the demands of official curricula, and students’ authentic needs. © 2024 The Authors},

A comprehensive sampling technique identified survey respondents whereas a purposive sampling technique selected participants for qualitative data. Employing a 5-point Likert scale questionnaires were framed to analyze input and method domains. Conversely, utilizing semi-structured interviews (four themes) and observations (seven themes) were categorized using NVIVO 12 Pro. Descriptive statistics illustrated the importance of input domains (familiar topics, feedback, knowledge elements, authentic materials, technology integration) and method domains (pre-, while and post-listening phases, and task-based instruction). However, qualitative findings showed inconsistencies between beliefs and practices indicating a need for more effective lesson planning, authentic materials, technology integration, and effective implementation of listening phases. Inferential statistics revealed a strong positive relationship between dependent and independent variables, which showed a significant impact. Consequently, a balanced approach to these domains is crucial for effective integration requiring professional development programs to address the finding’s disparities. The study recommends practical training, authentic material design, technology integration, and progressive assessment with an emphasis on lesson planning. It further suggests exploring practical interventions, comparative studies, longitudinal studies, and student focused studies to enhance the quality of these findings. © The Author(s) 2024.},

This study aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by investigating how TBLT affects practical classroom settings. Specifically, in addressing an area where Japanese EFL (JEFL) learners have traditionally struggled, this study investigates the effectiveness of task-based instruction on JEFL university students’ communicative confidence and willingness to communicate (WTC) in L2 English. To this end, a group of 32 JEFL university students (enrolled in an English Listening and Speaking course) participated in this study. Assessments of each participant’s communicative confidence and WTC in L2 English were conducted at the beginning and the end of the course (after 15 weeks, which consisted of approximately 45 hours of TBLT). Each of these assessments involved completing two questionnaires and subsequently being interviewed regarding their feelings concerning the instruction they received. The instruction provided between the Pre-test and Post-test followed the principles of TBLT. Specifically, over the course of fifteen weeks in this English Communication course, the instructor covered one of the fifteen units of a task-based coursebook/syllabus each week. Each unit in the syllabus involved the students engaging in a series of tasks, which included a Pre-Task, Core Task, First Listening (for gist), Second Listening (for analysis), Language Analysis Exercises, and Post-Task. The results, overall, showed that TBLT had an overwhelmingly positive impact on students’ communicative confidence and WTC in L2 English. © 2024 International Journal of TESOL Studies.},

A total of 80 participants took part in a 30-hour English language training program that focused on task-based language teaching (TBLT) implemented through online technology to enhance Thai monks’ speaking performance. Zoom and free online tools such as Pronunciation Checker App were integrated into the TBL learning cycle to deliver this online training. The research process can be summarized four stages consisting of orientation stage, pre-practicing stage, practicing stage, and post-practicing stage. The comparison of learning outcomes before and after the implementation of the instructional model for monks revealed a significant difference in the average scores. The overall score before training was 38.78 (S.D. = 5.85), while the post-training learning outcomes had a higher average score of 47.34 (S.D. = 4.99). The assessment of satisfaction was divided into four dimensions: (1) content and language usage; (2) English instructional activities for monks; (3) teaching and learning process; and (4) development of English-speaking skills. Overall, participants expressed high levels of satisfaction across all four dimensions of the instructional design approach, with a mean rating of 4.49 and a standard deviation of 0.56. © 2024 River Publishers.},

	abstract = {Research has found that levels of enjoyment and anxiety fluctuate on a moment-to-moment timescale during second language (L2) spoken task performances as learners attempt to cope with various communication challenges. For L2 speakers, surges in these emotions can limit or expand cognitive resources, affecting speech processing capability. However, at an intra-individual level, there is very little empirical evidence on how emotions and fluency are related during L2 spoken task performances. The present study uses the idiodynamic approach to examine the relationship between enjoyment, anxiety, and breakdown fluency (i.e., average length of pauses) during monolog tasks performed by university students who use English as an L2. After watching a video recording of their task performances, participants rated their anxiety and emotion levels on a per-second basis. Immediately after, they were interviewed about their attributions for fluctuations in their ratings. After segmenting task performances into 26 7-s segments of speech, per-person correlations revealed that (1) the (negative) relationship between anxiety and enjoyment varied from strong to very weak, and (2) the (positive) relationship between anxiety and breakdown fluency was much stronger than the (negative) relationship between enjoyment and breakdown fluency. Triangulation of anxiety and enjoyment ratings, stimulated recall interviews, and performance data led to the identification of four categories of factors that influenced the emotion-fluency relationship: task design factors (task structure, task topic), task implementation factors (pre-task planning, task time limits), cognitive-linguistic factors (momentary breakdowns in conceptualization and formulation speech processes), and achievement outcome factors (self-evaluations of appropriate and inappropriate language used).

The analysis focused on triangulating sources and methods in order to gain a more complete understanding of the oral tasks most important for student success. Three task types were identified in this regard: academic lectures, discussions, and presentations. A systematic comparison of the findings with the curriculum's learning outcomes and practices revealed that students' needs were largely being addressed. However, the evaluation also led to reliable conclusions about specific opportunities for curricular improvement for each task type. The results are discussed with an eye towards promoting the use of principled and rational NA in EAP. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {An enquiry into the present assessment practices in primary and secondary education in India shows that assessment of oral proficiency neither forms a part of certification exams nor is it regularly used for classroom purposes. In a few instances when assessments of speaking and listening are carried out, random topics are assigned to learners without checking for selection and/or gradation of task features using reliable conceptual frameworks, thereby limiting their assessment benefits. This paper presents an application of the Task-Based Speaking Assessment (TBSA) in the Indian ESL context by adapting Robinson’s Cognition Hypothesis (Cognition and second language instruction. Cambridge University Press, 2001a) as a conceptual base of selecting ‘task characteristics’ to design and sequence a series of speaking tasks and assessing learner performance based on a mapping of task-specific criteria. The paper validates the benefits of applying the TBSA model with evidence from a recent empirical study done with Indian learners. It demonstrates the pedagogical benefits of selecting and sequencing speaking tasks in that it leads to a gradual improvement in oral performance, especially in two microaspects of language-lexical variety and syntactic knowledge. Thereafter, the steps of designing task-specific assessment criteria are discussed to help teachers understand how task-specific attributes of speech can be incorporated in descriptors to measure linguistic as well as communicative attributes of speech of SL learners and give them meaningful feedback. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

	abstract = {This chapter investigates the experiences of a cohort of native and non-native English-speaking teachers participating in a task-based teacher training program at a network of bilingual schools in Honduras. Task-based language teaching (TBLT) is an approach to language teaching that utilizes tasks, driven by the authentic needs of the learners, as the basis of language curricula, syllabi, instruction, and assessment. This approach is in contrast to traditional language teaching, which typically organizes instruction around grammar, vocabulary, or other discrete language forms. TBLT focuses on the grammatical forms that naturally arise from tasks relevant to learners and is therefore thought to be more compatible with natural second language development. English-Spanish bilingualism is perceived as a significant asset in Honduras and is viewed as a critically important factor in access to further education and employment. English language proficiency is recognized as a marketable skill due to the demand for English speakers in local call centers, factories, and tourism industries. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Kathleen Bailey and Donna Christian; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	doi = {10.3390/educsci10110306},
	abstract = {This research involved the design of a task-based dialogue system and evaluation of its learning effectiveness. Dialogue training still heavily depends on human communication with instant feedback or correction. However, it is not possible to provide a personal tutor for every English learner. With the rapid development of information technology, digitized learning and voice communication is a possible solution. The goal of this research was to develop an innovative model to refine the task-based dialogue system, including natural language understanding, disassembly intention, and dialogue state tracking. To enable the dialogue system to find the corresponding sentence accurately, the dialogue system was designed with machine learning algorithms to allow users to communicate in a task-based fashion. Past research has pointed out that computer-assisted instruction has achieved remarkable results in language reading, writing, and listening. Therefore, the direction of the discussion is to use the task-oriented dialogue system as a speaking teaching assistant. To train the speaking ability, the proposed system provides a simulation environment with goal-oriented characteristics, allowing learners to continuously improve their language fluency in terms of speaking ability by simulating conversational situational exercises. To evaluate the possibility of replacing the traditional English speaking practice with the proposed system, a small English speaking class experiment was carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Data of 28 students with three assigned tasks were collected and analyzed. The promising results of the collected students’ feedback confirm the positive perceptions toward the system regarding user interface, learning style, and the system’s effectiveness. © 2020 by the authors.

Other-initiated repair (OIR) strategies are the strategies that can be deployed to solve understanding problems that deal not only to linguistics aspect but also hearing problems, poor speech delivery, or overall misunderstanding of intended meaning by the speakers in interaction. This paper aimed at outlining the way the pre-service EFL teachers’ ability in using the OIR Strategies is assessed by using task-based assessment. Theoretical and empirical arguments were provided to support the development of communicative tasks assessment consisting of the assessment instruments, procedures, validation, blue-print, and validation. The developed assessment was implemented to a group of EFL pre-service teachers in a teacher college of Widya Mandira Catholic University in Indonesia. The result showed that the students were able to employ a set of OIR strategies to address the understanding problem in the interaction with their peers. It is concluded that the communicative task assessment is an effective way to elicit the students’ ability in using OIR Strategies in the interaction so it should be incorporated in the speaking instruction to enhance the students communicative competence © 2021.

Each test taker gets a distinct score on each of the three tasks, a fourth score for pronunciation on all three tasks, and a fifth score for grammar-vocabulary on all three tasks. Confirmatory Factor Analyses were conducted on the scores of 23,793 test takers across three years. Interpretation of the best-fitting bifactor model suggests that (1) the contribution of language ability and contextual factors to test scores can be separately assessed and (2) task performance is a multidimensional construct involving both language ability and topical knowledge.

Two trained raters scored the task-based pragmatic performances using analytical rating criteria and displayed a satisfactory level of consistency and accuracy in scoring the performances. The test-takers' retrospective reports were transcribed and analyzed to develop a valid coding scheme that consists of cognitive, metacognitive, and pragmatic strategies. An association between the test-takers' pragmatic performances scored by the trained raters and their reported strategy use was examined. The higher-ability test takers utilized diverse strategies more frequently, ranging from varied pragmatic strategies to strategies specifically related to managing task demands, compared to the lower-ability test takers. Further, the test takers utilized distinct types of strategies appropriate to handling unique pragmatic task situations and complexities involved in each pragmatic assessment task. These findings explain how the test takers cognitively interacted with the assessment tasks and what strategies potentially led to successful pragmatic performances.

	abstract = {Multiliteracies are an indispensable component of language abilities in the modern age of information technology. First proposed by the New London Group in 1996, multiliteracies refer to the abilities needed to obtain the learning resources that are transmitted through different media and modals, and to apply different modes and means to communicate with others to create meanings. The cultivation of multiliteracies is not only a systematic process of constructing knowledge but also a dynamic cycle of designing learning activities. In undertaking an international multiliteracies project, the New London Group adopted a mode of learning by design to cultivate multiliteracies. Learning by design includes three progressive components of available design, designing, and redesigned, with available design referring to the learning resources available, designing being the work to be done to make use of the learning resources obtained, and redesigned meaning the regenerated and transformed learning resources that are to become the new learning resources for available design. When it comes to the stage of redesigned, the mode of learning by design enters a new cycle. Ever since learning by design was adopted, it became the main theoretical framework used to cultivate multiliteracies. The college English teaching subsequently developed at Soochow University followed and specified the general principles of learning by design while constructing its own specific mode, trying to integrate available design and designing into a dynamic whole geared toward cultivating multiliteracies (one of the three abilities needed to use English, together with language expression abilities and intercultural communication competences). With regard to available design, efforts were made toward building and expanding various learning resources, facilities, settings, environments, and other learning support systems at Soochow University. This was done to provide easy and selectable accesses to the Net+ based126 1. Introduction To satisfy the increasing demands for the cultivation of new skillsets in the 21st century, there have been significant adjustments and reforms of college English teaching as regards its objectives, contents, approaches, and evaluations. To provide nationwide guidance for college English teaching practice and research in China, the National Collegiate Foreign Language Teaching Advisory Board, under the Ministry of Education, revised the College English Curriculum Teaching Requirements (abbreviated hereafter as the Requirements (yao qiu)) and in 2015 completed the Guidelines for College English Teaching (abbreviated hereafter as the Guidelines (zhi nan)). In the Requirements that were put into trial implementation in 2004 and officially enforced in 2007, the main focus of college English teaching was cultivating students' comprehensive abilities to use English, particularly the abilities of listening and speaking. As teaching situations and students' needs for English learning changed, the Guidelines amended the Requirements to make it clear and specific that the teaching objective for college English was to cultivate students' abilities to use English for effective communication in school life, academic study, social exchange, and career development. It was also stated in the Guidelines that different colleges and universities needed to specifically program their own college English teaching objectives in accordance with their respective teaching realities and situations. From the compulsory Requirements to the directive Guidelines, college English teaching is no longer unitary on a national scale; different colleges and universities have been given more decision-making power to carry out their own college English teaching practices. The Guidelines, as the name indicates, lay a practical basis for colleges and universities to define the specific contents of their college English teaching and research programs, in order to tailor their focus on students' English application abilities. 2. Multiliteracies The abilities needed to use English, which are a systematic integration of the knowledge multimedia forms of different learning resources and specific course contents. In designing, different task-based and project-driven classroom and extracurricular/term explorative learning activities, particularly those revolving around the two courses of Film English and Media English Reading, were created for students to actively undertake cooperative and interactive learning, facilitating their language application. The teaching of available design and designing was interdependently progressed and students' language acquisition and application were systematically integrated to promote the effective cultivation of multiliteracies. © 2017 Soochow University.},

The terms "Autonomy" and "Self Direction" are being used more frequently in educational to discussion. This article identifier and examines the factors which contribute to these, including the minority rights movement, shifts in educational philosophy, reactions for or against behaviorism, linguistic pragmatism, access to educations increase the commercialization educational material for teaching greater availability of current technologies. A number of objection to "Autonomy" (It could not work with children or adult at low educational attainment not for difficult language, or in examination led Syllabus) have largely overcome, research into a wide range of educational topics, such as learning styles and strategies, resources centre and counselor and leaner training has directly contributed to present practice much remains to be explored. However, particularly cultural influenced on language learning. Learner autonomy has long been defines as the ability to take charge of one's own learning (Holic, 1981) in Other words, learners must be independent from others instruction and directing in order to develop autonomy (Benson, 1996). Teachers hold positive attitudes towards the promotion of learner's autonomy in language as the facilitators, counselor, and variable resources (Dujng and Sheepo, 2014). Learner Autonomy as a subject for research and as an educational goal, has gamed a lot of traction in recent years. Autonomy is now a common theme at conferences and in professional journals and is well on the radar of the average language teacher. The Idea that learners need to be able to take control over their own learning to be successful not just in class, but to learn independently without a teacher outside the class, has become widely accepted in mainstream language teaching (Benson, 2001). Breen's process syllabus (1987) and Nunan is (1988) Learner centered approach are examples of this. More recent approaches to learning and teaching, such as task based language teaching include elements that can support the development of autonomous learning skills (Errey \& Scholart, 2005) in general, there is now a broader awareness at importance of developing language and autonomous learning skills in addition to the language competencies. The development of learner autonomy is sometimes carried out through 'Leaner training" or dedicated strategy instruction often through self-Access centers (Gardner of Miller, 2014). Most likely autonomous learners are those who explicitly accept responsibility for their own learning (e.q. little, 1991) the autonomous shows initiative in the learning process and share in monitoring. Progress and evaluating the extent to which learning is achieved (Schurk, 2005). There is a need to make students aware of the hidden potential within each and to find ways in which this can be explored when students become more autonomous and involved in their own learning, take an active part in making decisions. This may result in students feel a sense of ownership and commitment to the process this learning night be more meaning full, resulting in better classroom performance. There fore, teacher can help students in cover and develop the skills which will allow them to manage their own learning and survive outside the sheltered environment of the classroom, when the teacher is no longer there for support. Research done in the area of second language acquisition suggest how this night be achieved work in language learning in the last half of the twentieth century, has brought is closer to understanding the complex nature of this process. Research in area such is multiple intelligences (gardner, 2010), individual learning stylis and learning strategies (Rus,1978, Cohen,1988, Molley \& Chamid;1990), motivation (Dormyei,2001) and cognition (Schimdt,1990, Crass, Svetie \& Lemelin,2003) have given us insight into the ways in which deferent factors influence learners and the way they learn. Added to this is the move toward learner-centered father than teacher centered-classroom (Nunan,1999), giving students opportunity to become active participants in the learning process, making decisions with regard to learning objectives and materials to be used, helping decide the evaluation process, and this moving toward becoming independent and autonomous learners. My intention is to provide an overview of issues concerning learner autonomy and other related area which have an influence on self-Access language learning (SALL) We begin by examining the debate surrounding autonomy and identifying the mayor influences which have contributed in this debate. This debate will not be discussed after this chapter because it is not central to the purpose of the problem It is, however, an important starting point for talking about SALL The reminder of the chapter focuses specifically on SALL by identifying its characteristics the beliefs and attitudes which affect the acceptance of SALL The change in roles which is required of both learners and teachers The challenges of promoting speaking in SALL The kinds of learning environment in which SALL can take place Possible areas of resistant to SALL Finally we discuss issues related to the costs of establishing and mounting SALL.},

The present research was an attempt to investigate the connection between task-free/task-based self-assessment and learners' self-perceived communicative competence in speaking. To examine the link, 48 upper-intermediate and advanced language learners participated in the study. Data were collected via a self-perceived communicative competence questionnaire, the learners' self-assessment (task-based and task-free) scores, and the teachers' assessment of learners speaking. The analysis of the obtained data revealed a difference between the learners' task-based and task-free self-assessment, and a high relationship between their self-perceived communicative competence and their self-assessment of speaking. Results also revealed a positive correlation between the learners' task-based and task-free self-assessment of speaking and that of their teachers. Findings highlight the importance of self-assessment and task-based assessment in language learning to foster learner involvement. © 2017 Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz.},

This TBL activity provided the students with an entertaining motivation to use English for cultural exploration in the context of an increasingly popular medium for everyday communication. The activity also provided useful data for several types of task-based assessment (TBA): (1) integrative assessments to assess proficiency in production skills, namely, speaking and writing; (2) communicative assessments, in which a large amount of communication or negotiation is expected; and (3) multi-phase assessments, in which self-assessment and peer assessment both occur within the proposed assessment task.

The participants were 30 female intermediate participants ranged from 14 to 18 year old studying at one English language institute in Shiraz, Iran. A sample model of Oxford Placement Test was used to determine the participants' level of English proficiency. Then, the participants were asked to give impromptu presentations about unfamiliar topics. Their oral presentations were evaluated as pre-tests. In order to administer post-tests participants were asked to work on a new topic for the subsequent session. All oral presentations were evaluated through Brown and Abeywickrama (2010) checklist. Using SPSS software, paired- sample t-test was used to analyze the collected data. The results indicated that there was significant difference between mean scores of pre-tests and post-tests.

Active acquisition of Hebrew accelerates in the immersion conditions of high education. I explore the persistence of very common interference errors in various linguistic domains, as established by teachers' written corrective feedback, and the correlation between persistence, error salience and a general learner effect. From a corpus of 56 Hebrew essays written by 9th graders, 11th graders and undergraduate students in southern Israel, the 14 most frequent interference errors were isolated and incorporated in a compiled test essay, which was then given to 13 L1 Arabicspeaking teachers of Hebrew to correct. The salience of each item was established by the percentage of teachers correcting it; each was also graded for its status as a general learners' error. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between each of these two measures and persistence over the time period studied. This corroborates a multiple effect approach to persistence. Localized errors of phonology, orthography, and morphology generally declined faster than syntactic errors, which persisted especially in structures that occur in L1 Hebrew, marked for discourse-pragmatic effects. © 2020 International Association for Research in L1-Education.

In response to positive psychology's emphasis on learner engagement and well-being, this study investigated how an instructional AI chatbot and an AI-based speaking assessment system, introduced midway through the course, could enhance instruction and support speaking practice. Utilizing three-round speaking tests and questionnaires, supplemented by semi-structured interviews, this study examined how AI-supported language learning influenced learners' speaking performance, along with key affective variables closely related to the speaking experience: Willingness to Communicate (WTC), Self-Perceived Communicative Competence (SCC), and Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA). A total of 103 Chinese EFL learners participated in the experiment. The quantitative results indicated that AI, compared to human teachers and peers, was more effective in enhancing learners' speaking performance, WTC, and SCC. The qualitative data suggest that this may be attributed to learners feeling more comfortable and secure when producing English in AI-mediated online environments, which reduced social pressure and fostered greater self-expression. In addition to identifying the limitations of AI-supported speaking instruction, the study offers practical guidance for teachers seeking to incorporate diverse AI tools into online classroom activities to foster both linguistic development and positive emotional experiences.  © 2025 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

This study investigated the impact of GAI chatbots on elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' speaking skills, focusing on two interaction configurations—individual and paired. Eighty-five elementary school EFL learners participated in a three-week summer program, engaging in daily 45-min interactions with CoolE Bot. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) individual interaction with CoolE Bot (I-Bot group), (2) paired interaction with CoolE Bot (P-Bot group), and (3) interaction with teachers and peers in a conventional English classroom (No-Bot group). In each class, participants in the Bot group received worksheets with a topic, prompts, and vocabulary to guide their interactions with CoolE Bot, while those in the No-Bot group also received worksheets for comparable activities. Quantitative (English-speaking tests) and qualitative data (semi-structured interviews) were collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the I-Bot and P-Bot groups' post-test speaking skills were significantly higher than those of the No-Bot group. CoolE Bot significantly improved the speaking skills of EFL learners. Both individual and paired interactions with CoolE Bot demonstrated positive effects, with no significant differences between groups. Interviews highlight CoolE Bot's adeptness in coherent interaction, charismatic conversational style with a human-like voice, diverse topic discussions tailored to learners' interests, and supportive functions. The participants found GAI chatbot-assisted EFL speaking enjoyable, motivating, and engaging appreciating its cartoonish, human-like characters, conversational style, and voice. Additionally, CoolE Bot fostered rapport and a supportive environment enhancing learners' confidence and reducing anxiety regarding EFL speaking. Individual interactions encourage personalized engagement and self-directed learning, whereas paired interactions involve social dynamics, shared learning experiences, and mutual resolution of language challenges. © 2024},

However, little is known about the impact of AI-mediated activities on learners' speaking skills. This study, therefore, aimed to examine the impact of an artificial intelligence platform on English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' speaking skills, including speaking fluency and coherence, lexicon, grammatical range and accuracy, and pronunciation, and willingness to communicate (WTC). EFL learners' attitudes and perceptions towards AI-mediated speaking activities were also qualitatively explored. Thirty-three EFL learners were randomly assigned to an experimental group (AI group) and 32 EFL learners were placed in a control group (face-to-face group). The participants in the AI group engaged in AI-mediated interactive speaking activities using Andy English Chatbot, whilst the face-to-face group engaged in conventional peer-interaction speaking activities. Moreover, IELTS speaking skill tests and a WTC scale were applied to collect the quantitative data followed by an individual semi-structured interview in the qualitative phase. The results indicated that AI-mediated interactive speaking activities were more effective in improving EFL learners’ speaking skills and WTC. Moreover, the learners had positive attitudes and perceptions towards the AI-mediated speaking instruction.

	abstract = {Many learners of English as a foreign language often feel that learning spoken English is frustrating and quite difficult, especially when they have to talk to English-speaking foreigners. In general, because they are unfamiliar with the spoken mode of English and are worried about making grammatical errors, they often feel very scared to speak English. Furthermore, spoken language and reading differ in many ways. For instance, when seeing text containing new words, learners can stop and look up words in a dictionary. Additionally, a passage can be read multiple times by learners to understand it. Conversely, spoken language must be understood immediately in order to communicate effectively. The purpose of this study is to propose an interactive chatbot system named TPBOT which stands for “TOEIC Practice Chatbot” for EFL learners to eliminate their fear of speaking English and enable them to chat with online chatbots to practice spoken English at any time. This TPBOT would be very helpful to eliminate learners’ anxiety about speaking a foreign language with foreigners. Participants in this study are Taiwanese students whose oral scores on the TOEIC® test are below 100. They hope to improve their oral English ability after participating in the four-month experiment. The results have shown that students are satisfied with using this TPBOT and believe that it has indeed helped them improve their English speaking skills. Obviously, the TPBOT was very effective for the intended purpose. For educators, the TPBOT is very useful to build learning content in the TPBOT, provide learners with interactive exercises and improve learning effects. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Some existing studies have highlighted the use of chatbots in relation to specific L2 skills, yet unfortunately, the user experience component of chatbot interaction has not been empirically researched. This study investigates the effect of chatbot-human interaction with the chatbot Replika on L2 speaking performance and speaking anxiety. The participants in the current study were 90 EFL students from a state university in Turkey. They used the application Replika for twelve weeks practicing targeted subjects outside the class. Each student was assessed with the L2 speaking anxiety scale both before and after the intervention. Also, an open-ended questionnaire was administered to collect their perceptions of using chatbots for L2 speaking practice. The interactions with the chatbot were screen taped for a randomly chosen speaking task: Well-being. The findings reveal that there were negative perceptions and attitudes toward the chatbot interaction. Students reported facing difficulties in being understood precisely, which might have contributed to higher anxiety in L2 speaking. Notably, student performance with Replika was significantly better than their face-to-face peer interactions. Overall, the results show that although chatbot interaction is a novel way to provide speaking practice for students, the actual interaction with a chatbot might not be a reliable way to lessen their anxiety with L2 speaking. © 2022 Children Research Center.

	abstract = {One of the most significant barriers to English learning for EFL (English as a Foreign Language) students is a lack of practice environments. Additionally, in the (EFL) classroom, emotions such as speaking anxiety and language enjoyment may influence students’ performance. It is well established that students’ achievement is harmed by foreign language anxiety. Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements present an opportunity to solve this issue. AI chatbots are capable of deciphering the meanings of users’ comments and responding appropriately and have been built to engage with users using natural language. Language teachers and researchers have recommended the use of chatbots as tools of learning that would help to facilitate the implementation of language learning by acting as a speaking partner or tutor. In this research design, AI chatbot is employed in Casual Conversation Course as self-regulated learning for facilitating students’ speaking performance and interactions during the learning process in a university speaking classroom. By a preceding conversation with AI chatbot, it will alleviate speaking anxiety, boost learning enjoyment, and foster students’ critical thinking. In-depth interviews were delivered to four interviewees to ascertain the designed learning model from the teachers’ viewpoint. The result indicates that the proposed model is expected to be able to aid the learning process and so achieve the course’s objectives more effectively than conventional models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {To foster second language (L2) learners’ speaking abilities, practicing speaking regularly is necessary, including regular assessments and individual feedback to learners. However, in current classroom settings, practicing and assessing speaking are often neglected. For teachers, it is particularly hard to provide individualized feedback on speaking, speaking being a loud and transient phenomenon. Additionally, recording speech and thus providing individual assessments and feedback based on recordings is highly time-consuming. Therefore, to alleviate the amount of work needed for individual assessments, teachers and learners would be helped with automated speaking assessments. In this paper, we first describe the requirements for high-quality, practical, and ethical tools for automated scoring of and feedback on L2 speaking performances. Subsequently, we describe and evaluate existing tools of automated L2 speaking assessment. We conclude that none of the described tools meet all the identified requirements. Combining insights from the AI-based assessment framework (Fang et al., 2023) with an educational design approach, we offer recommendations intended to guide computational linguists together with researchers and practitioners in education and assessment on how to successfully integrate computational research with educational design. The goal of such future research is to develop generative AI (GenAI)-based systems that are technically sound, ethically responsible, and likely to be adopted in educational practice. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study introduces a novel method for explainable speaking skill assessment that utilizes a unique dataset featuring video recordings of conversational interviews for high-stakes outcomes (i.e., admission to high schools and universities). Unlike traditional automated speaking assessments that prioritize accuracy at the expense of interpretability, our approach employs a new multimodal dataset that integrates acoustic and linguistic features, visual cues, turn-taking patterns, and expert-derived scores quantifying various speaking skill aspects observed during interviews with young adolescents. This dataset is distinguished by its open-ended question format, which allows for varied responses from interviewees, providing a rich basis for analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that fusing interpretable features, including prosody, action units, and turn-taking, significantly enhances the accuracy of spoken English skill prediction, achieving an overall accuracy of 83\% when a machine learning model based on the light gradient boosting algorithm is used. Furthermore, this research underscores the significant influence of external factors, such as interviewer behavior and the interview setting, particularly on the coherence aspect of spoken English proficiency. This focus on an innovative dataset and interpretable assessment tools offers a more nuanced understanding of speaking skills in high-stakes contexts than that offered by previous studies. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Automated speaking assessment (ASA) of second language proficiency benefits both learners and educators. However, developing these systems for less commonly taught languages like Finnish and Finland Swedish is hindered by the need for large datasets with equal representation of all proficiency levels. Traditional machine learning algorithms used in ASA are data-driven and consequently struggle to generalize to underrepresented proficiency levels. This study leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance scoring performance in underrepresented proficiency levels through two approaches: augmenting the learner’s corpus with LLM-generated transcripts (simulating data) and applying LLMs to score the transcripts of learners’ responses directly. Our findings show that both solutions are comparable to or better than a traditional machine learning model trained on the original data for proficiency levels with fewer examples. Additionally, we found that providing LLMs with examples of human grading at various proficiency levels significantly enhances their performance as graders, especially when compared to using a single demonstration or none at all. Finally, our study confirms that using automatic speech recognition transcripts instead of human transcripts does not compromise assessment quality, enabling the development of LLM-based systems that can generate proficiency ratings directly from audio input. © The Author(s) 2025.

Speaking assessments typically rely on human raters, making automation a crucial step toward broader scalability. This work presents a system for automatic spoken language assessment, developed in the context of Ceibal en Inglés, a national educational program in Uruguay that provides English instruction to thousands of students in public primary and secondary schools. Designed to evaluate both speech production and semantic content in students’ responses, the system incorporates analysis components tailored to different aspects of oral performance. The speaking assessment includes exercises where students record responses to prompts, such as short questions, extended responses, and image-based tasks. For speech production, we employ a multi-task pronunciation assessment model designed to evaluate multiple aspects of spoken output. For semantic content, we developed a pipeline starting with automatic speech recognition (ASR), followed by a large language model (LLM) guided by customized prompt sets for each test part. We evaluated the system components using different datasets that reflect the linguistic and demographic profiles of the target student population. The proposed approach, which combines speech analysis and Natural Language Processing, has proven to be an effective solution for addressing the automatic evaluation of spoken language and supports ongoing efforts toward its real-world implementation in large-scale educational programs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Automated speech assessment still faces the challenge of accurate recognition of diverse English accents. However, benefitting from temporal and contextual variations in speech data, traditional models that we use such as CNNs and HMMs are not sufficiently able to do so. This study overcomes the above challenges with a hybrid BiLSTM-Transformer model, where BiLSTM handles sequential dependencies in the speech signal, and the Transformer is for the long-range contextual relationship. Together, these generate a more complex view of accent and speech variability. It uses Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as features and is trained on the CSTR VCTK Corpus of English that includes English accents. The proposed model carries an accuracy of 95.6\%, precision of 93.4\%, recall of 92.5\%, and 92.9\% as F1 score, which corresponds to a recognition error of 4.4\%. This quantitatively shows a considerable improvement compared to traditional models. The model is in fact built with such high responsiveness that it is well suited for live situations, i.e. automated interviews or language learning tools, with an average latency in the order of 180 ms per utterance. Also, the system demonstrates state of the art performance between speech and vegetative users, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. Based on this research, a reliable and accurate solution for English accent classification and speech emotion recognition is established through the use of BiLSTM-Transformer architecture.  © 2025 IEEE.},

The program focuses on the pragmatics aspect of spoken communication, in which the language choices we make are affected by socio-contextual factors such as relative social status and familiarity with the interlocutor. In so doing, the C-DLA aims to address a number of challenges. Requesting is an important, but challenging skill for many learners, and yet is also undertaught in the language classroom, due to time and resource constraints. Further, assessments typically evaluate the learner holistically, providing an overall score, without providing insight into specific aspects of the learner's performance. A C-DLA addresses these challenges by employing a three-stage process: i) assessment administration; ii) provision of immediate individualized feedback to the learner that promotes learning, and iii) further instruction provision, based on the assessment results. Computerization of the DLA widens access, allowing large numbers of learners to engage with the program simultaneously. Here, we provide a rationale for the C-DLA and an outline of the key challenges - namely, speech recognition of L2 English, identification of pragmatic inappropriateness in a learner's interactive speaking performance and automated feedback delivery. We further provide a proof-of-concept for the C-DLA, in which the program administers a number of interactive spoken requesting tasks to the learner, acts as an automated spoken dialogue interlocutor, and provides immediate, automated pragmatics-focused feedback when necessary. © 2025 IEEE.},

Especially for non-native speakers, accents, non-standard pronunciation, and mixed languages can easily lead to model recognition errors, which in turn affect the accuracy of scoring. This paper introduces a pronunciation assessment model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for automatic pronunciation scoring on an English speaking training platform. First, this paper collects audio data through a high-quality microphone and preprocesses it, including noise removal, normalization, and audio frame segmentation. Then, the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and other speech features (spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, pitch, etc.) are used to extract audio features to provide input data for model training. In terms of model construction, this paper designs a CNN-based deep learning architecture, which extracts local features of audio signals through multi-layer convolution and pooling operations, and scores pronunciation through a fully connected layer. In order to evaluate the performance of the model, the experiment divides the dataset into a training set and a validation set and uses the cross entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer for training. During the training process, the model’s accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score performed well (above 0.7), verifying the effectiveness of CNN in the pronunciation evaluation task. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.},

	abstract = {Automatic Speech Scoring (ASS) has increasingly become a useful tool in oral proficiency testing for Second Language (L2) learners. However, limited studies investigate the alignment of ASS indices with the Complexity, Accuracy, and Fluency (CAF)—the three dimensions in evaluating L2 speakers’ oral proficiency, and the subsequent impact indices on the oral performance of Chinese college students. To bridge this gap, this study used comparative analysis, Pearson analysis, and linear regression analysis to delve into the relationship and correlations between paired ASS indicators of “pronunciation”, “fluency”, “integrity”, “speed”, “duration”, and “overall”, while also analyzing the relationships between “overall” and other variables. These analyses were conducted using 956 audio clips of freshmen who took the College English Test-Spoken English Test Band 4 (CET-SET-4) in May 2022 in China. The findings reveal that (1) the ASS indicators and evaluation methods are similar but not identical to those employed in prior studies; (2) “pronunciation” encapsulates both the accuracy and fluency dimensions of CAF; (3) “pronunciation” and “integrity” have significant impacts on Chinese college students’ oral English performance in read-aloud tasks. The study suggests that future research should further investigate the specific pronunciation challenges faced by Chinese college students, such as phonetics, stress, and intonation. Additionally, it highlights the need to comprehend teachers’ attitudes and preferences towards ASS to enhance its effectiveness in assessing second language (L2) learners’ oral proficiency. The study would provide some references to teachers for oral English teaching design and students for their self-assessment of oral English proficiencies. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The speech samples were each 2 minutes long and ranged in proficiency levels. The raters scored each sample on fluency, vocabulary, grammar, and comprehensibility using 7-point semantic differential scales. Nonverbal behavior was extracted using an automated machine learning software called iMotions, and data was analyzed with ordinal mixed effects regression. Results showed that attentional variance predicted fluency, vocabulary, and grammar scores, but only when accounting for proficiency. Higher standard deviations of attention corresponded with lower scores for the lower-proficiency group, but not the mid/higher-proficiency group. Comprehensibility scores were only predicted by mean valence when proficiency was an interaction term. Higher mean valence, or positive emotional behavior, corresponded with higher scores in the lower-proficiency group, but not the mid/higher-proficiency group. Effect sizes for these predictors were quite small, with small amounts of variance explained. These results have implications for construct representation and test fairness. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Automatic speech scoring is crucial in language learning, providing targeted feedback to language learners by assessing pronunciation, fluency, and other speech qualities. However, the scarcity of human-labeled data for languages beyond English poses a significant challenge in developing such systems. In this work, we propose a Language-Independent scoring approach to evaluate speech without relying on labeled data in the target language. We introduce a multilingual speech scoring system that leverages representations from the wav2vec 2.0 XLSR model and a force-alignment technique based on CTC-Segmentation to construct speech features. These features are used to train a machine learning model to predict pronunciation and fluency scores. We demonstrate the potential of our method by predicting expert ratings on a speech dataset spanning five languages-English, French, Spanish, German and Portuguese, and comparing its performance against Language-Specific models trained individually on each language, as well as a jointly-trained model on all languages. Results indicate that our approach shows promise as an initial step towards a universal language independent speech scoring.

	abstract = {In an interconnected world where English has become the lingua franca of culture, entertainment, business, and academia, the growing demand for learning English as a second language (L2) has led to an increasing interest in automatic approaches for assessing spoken language proficiency. In this regard, mastering grammar is one of the key elements of L2 proficiency. In this paper, we illustrate an approach to L2 proficiency assessment and feedback based on grammatical features using only publicly available data for training and a small proprietary dataset for testing. Specifically, we implement it in a cascaded fashion, starting from learners’ utterances, investigating disfluency detection, exploring spoken grammatical error correction (GEC), and finally using grammatical features extracted with the spoken GEC module for proficiency assessment. We compare this grading system to a BERT-based grader and find that the two systems have similar performances when using manual transcriptions, but their combinations bring significant improvements to the assessment performance and enhance validity and explainability. Instead, when using automatic transcriptions, the GEC-based grader obtains better results than the BERT-based grader. The results obtained are discussed and evaluated with appropriate metrics across the proposed pipeline. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown stellar performance compared to traditional methods. However, SSL-based ASA systems are faced with at least three data-related challenges: limited annotated data, uneven distribution of learner proficiency levels and non-uniform score intervals between different CEFR proficiency levels. To address these challenges, we explore the use of two novel modeling strategies: metric-based classification and loss re-weighting, leveraging distinct SSL-based embedding features. Extensive experimental results on the ICNALE benchmark dataset suggest that our approach can outperform existing strong baselines by a sizable margin, achieving a significant improvement of more than 10\% in CEFR prediction accuracy. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

Although prior ASAC approaches have shown promising performance on their respective datasets, there is still a dearth of research specifically focused on incorporating the coherence of the logical flow within a conversation into the grading model. To address this critical challenge, we propose a hierarchical graph model that aptly incorporates both broad inter-response interactions (e.g., discourse relations) and nuanced semantic information (e.g., semantic words and speaker intents), which is subsequently fused with contextual information for the final prediction. Extensive experimental results on the NICT-JLE benchmark dataset suggest that our proposed modeling approach can yield considerable improvements in prediction accuracy with respect to various assessment metrics, as compared to some strong baselines. This also sheds light on the importance of investigating coherence-related facets of spoken responses in ASAC. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper explores what the measures of utterance fluency typically employed in Automatic Speech Evaluation (ASE), i.e. automated speaking assessments, tell us about oral proficiency. 60 Chinese learners of English completed the second part of the speaking section of IELTS and six tasks designed to measure the linguistic knowledge and processing assumed to underpin second language speech production. A sample of eight native speakers rated the learners’ oral productions for functional adequacy. Analyses of the data confirm: (1) articulation rate, mid-clause pause frequency, and repetition frequency predict functional adequacy, (2) breadth of lexical knowledge is the main predictor of articulation rate as well as functional adequacy, (3) speed of syntactic processing predicts end-clause pause duration and speed of lexical processing predicts mid-clause pause duration, and (4) measures of utterance fluency together account for 60\% of the variation in functional adequacy scores. These findings suggest that articulation rate best reflects overall functional adequacy. Moreover, other measures of utterance fluency reflect different areas of underlying knowledge and processing, opening up the possibility of automating diagnostic speaking tests. © 2023 The Author(s).

Methodology: We developed a system with a tripartite structure using an automatic speech recogniser, a set of modules that compute a number of speech features, and a scoring model. In total, 210 participants with intermediate English language proficiency level were administered a multi-turn oral DCT, a task which closely resembles discourse in real-life situations. The collected speech and transcribed files were eyeballed and rated by human raters first. Eighty percent of the original dataset was then used to train and examine our prediction model against the remainder of the dataset. Findings: The exact agreement between human and machine scores was 72\%, moderately high, and comparable to the literature on automated speech scoring. It could provide a basis for deploying the system in a low-stakes practice environment. Originality/value: This study makes a unique contribution to the wider scholarship, where the use of single-turn DCTs remains prevalent, by presenting a new reliable scoring system for learner speech using an automated DCT with multiple turns. It offers useful insight into ways in which the system could be used in a low-stakes environment, including foreign language classroom settings. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

BERT excels at contextual representation learning while BiLSTM captures sequential dependencies in speech. Despite recent advancements, prior studies have not fully exploited the synergies of these models for accurate English speech analysis. This paper makes novel contributions by proposing the first BERT-BiLSTM fusion model tailored to English speech scoring. When evaluated on the TIMIT dataset, BERTOphone achieved 12.6\% Word Error Rate and 87.4\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models like LAS and CSS.

	abstract = {When assessing second language proficiency (L2), evaluation of spontaneous speech performance is crucial. This paper presents a corpus of spontaneous L2 English speech, focusing on the speech performance of B1 and B2 proficiency speakers. Two hundred and sixty university students were recorded during a speaking task as part of a French national certificate in English. This task entailed a 10-minute role-play among 2 or 3 candidates, arguing about a controversial topic, in order to reach a negotiated compromise. Each student's performance was evaluated by two experts, categorizing them into B2, B1 or below B1 speaking proficiency levels. Automatic diarization, transcription, and alignment at the word level were performed on the recorded conversations, in order to analyse lexical stress realisation in polysyllabic plain words of B1 and B2 proficiency students. Results showed that only 35.4\% of the 6,350 targeted words had stress detected on the expected syllable, revealing a common stress shift to the final syllable. Besides a substantial inter-speaker variability (0\% to 68.4\%), B2 speakers demonstrated a slightly higher stress accuracy (36\%) compared to B1 speakers (29.6\%). Those with accurate stress placement utilized F0 and intensity to make syllable prominence, while speakers with lower accuracy tended to lengthen words on their last syllables, with minimal changes in other dimensions. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.},

	abstract = {This study presents the development of a system for evaluating English-speaking proficiency based on the IELTS framework. We employed data collection, analysis, and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. The system focuses on using the statistical features extracted from the transcription of the speaking test. The initial model (XGBoost) showed a mean squared error of 2.29. After feature reduction and hyperparameter tuning, performance improved, achieving an average cross-validation score of 1.57 with a variance of 0.3872 across five folds. Our analysis found that lexical diversity, measured by the total number of unique words, is the most influential factor in predicting IELTS scores, while other features had minimal impact. Despite the improvements, the model does not account for critical speech components like fluency and pronunciation. Future research should address these aspects to better align with IELTS criteria. This study contributes to natural language processing and linguistics by offering a new machine learning model for predicting IELTS scores from the test transcription. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Grammatical feedback is crucial for L2 learners, teachers, and testers. Spoken grammatical error correction (GEC) aims to supply feedback to L2 learners on their use of grammar when speaking. This process usually relies on a cascaded pipeline comprising an ASR system, disfluency removal, and GEC, with the associated concern of propagating errors between these individual modules. In this paper, we introduce an alternative “end-to-end” approach to spoken GEC, exploiting a speech recognition foundation model, Whisper. This foundation model can be used to replace the whole framework or part of it, e.g., ASR and disfluency removal. These end-to-end approaches are compared to more standard cascaded approaches on the data obtained from a free-speaking spoken language assessment test, Linguaskill. Results demonstrate that end-to-end spoken GEC is possible within this architecture, but the lack of available data limits current performance compared to a system using large quantities of text-based GEC data. Conversely, end-to-end disfluency detection and removal, which is easier for the attention-based Whisper to learn, does outperform cascaded approaches. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of providing feedback to candidates when using end-to-end systems for spoken GEC. ©2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The extensive use of automated speech scoring in large-scale speaking assessment can be revolutionary not only to test design and rating, but also to the learning and instruction of speaking based on how students and teachers perceive and react to this technology. However, its washback remained underexplored. This mixed-method study aimed to investigate the washback of TOEFL iBT Speaking’s SpeechRater on Chinese EFL learners through questionnaire and interviews, and explore its associations with test performance and its multi-levelled influential factors. The participants received a mixture of positive and negative washback, such as their motivated individual learning through personal devices, decreasing real-life communicative practices, and increasing exam-driven behaviours. Test takers’ personal understandings of automated speech scoring were found directly influential to the washback of SpeechRater that they experienced. Furthermore, their test scores of TOEFL iBT Speaking were positively correlated with the implicit washback of SpeechRater on their learning but uncorrelated with its explicit washback on their test preparation. The findings have been drawn on to propose a washback model of automated speech scoring and make suggestions to test designers, teachers and learners on how to boost its positive washback and mitigate its negative washback. This research has concluded the importance of test takers’ awareness of the integrated dimensions to evaluate spoken English in real-life use. Accordingly, instructional implications are discussed on how teachers can guide the students to utilize automated speech scoring in learning and set up comprehensive learning goals for spoken English. © 2023, The Author(s).},

With the rise in demand for such assessments, it has become increasingly necessary to have the automated human-interpretable results to prevent inconsistencies and ensure meaningful feedback to the second language learners. Feature-based classical approaches have been more interpretable in understanding what the scoring model learns. Therefore, in this work, we utilize classical machine learning models to formulate a speech scoring task as both a classification and a regression problem, followed by a thorough study to interpret and study the relation between the linguistic cues and the English proficiency level of the speaker. First, we extract linguist features under five categories (fluency, pronunciation, content, grammar and vocabulary, and acoustic) and train models to grade responses. In comparison, we find that the regression-based models perform equivalent to or better than the classification approach. Second, we perform ablation studies to understand the impact of each of the feature and feature categories on the performance of proficiency grading. Further, to understand individual feature contributions, we present the importance of top features on the best performing algorithm for the grading task. Third, we make use of Partial Dependence Plots and Shapley values to explore feature importance and conclude that the best performing trained model learns the underlying rubrics used for grading the dataset used in this study. © 2022, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.},

	abstract = {This study investigates prosody and fluency of Finland Swedish as a second language (L2). The main objective is to investigate global measures of prosody and fluency as predictors of overall oral proficiency, fluency, and pronunciation ratings. We analyzed parameters related to temporal fluency, timing (based on syllable durations), and f0 change from spontaneous speech produced by 30 native and 235 non-native speakers of Finland Swedish representing proficiency levels from beginner to intermediate. We used pairwise comparisons to investigate the differences between native speech (L1) and L2 samples from different proficiency levels. To study the predictability of ratings with acoustic parameters, we fitted a multiple linear regression model for each assessed dimension of L2 skills. The comparison of L1 and L2 samples as well as L2 samples with different proficiency and fluency levels showed clear differences in f0 change and fluency parameters. Standard deviation of syllable durations also showed differences with respect to L2 learners’ fluency level. The results for multiple linear regression models, however, indicate contribution of rate-normalized standard deviation of syllable duration to fluency ratings, alongside traditionally used fluency parameters. As for proficiency ratings, f0 slope complemented fluency parameters in the prediction model. The predictive power of the parameters varied depending on the assessed dimension of L2 skills. This study provides new information on the prosodic features of Finland Swedish as a second language and suggests new research on the assessment of non-dominant varieties of pluricentric languages. The results support previous findings on the importance of speed and pausing measures in predicting oral L2 skills. However, further investigation of language-specific f0 and timing parameters as part of automated or computer-assisted speaking assessment is called for. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The automated speaking assessment method consists of mispronunciation detection and pronunciation quality assessment. In the past, researchers have usually focused their research on only one specific aspect of the speaking assessment task. Research on multifaceted speaking tasks has been rare, and model building has often led to reduced performance due to the omission of local feature details. In this paper, we propose a multi-width band (MB) method and apply it to the Conformer model. This method can effectively increase the ability of the model to obtain local feature information at different scales. At the same time, we used a multi-task learning approach to train a multifaceted speaking assessment model based on GOP features. We conducted experiments on a self-built monosyllabic Mandarin mispronunciation detection dataset (PSC-MonoSyllable) and an English open-source pronunciation quality assessment dataset (SpeechOcean762), respectively. The experimental results show that the method's mispronunciation detection metrics in terms of phonemes, tones, and words on the PSC-MonoSyllable dataset (F1 scores) reached 70.18\%, 80.06\%, and 79.82\%, respectively. The results of the method on the SpeechOcean 762 dataset for the pronunciation quality assessment task also showed a certain degree of improvement in all aspects of the phoneme-and grapheme-level correlation metrics compared with the baseline model. © 2013 IEEE.},

Analyses focus on a specific type of bias known as differential item functioning (DIF), which compares examinees of similar English language proficiency. Results show that there is a moderate amount of DIF, based on examinees’ L1 background in grade band 9–12. DIF is higher when scored by an OOS BERT model, indicating that BERT may exacerbate this bias; however, in practical terms, the degree to which BERT exacerbates DIF is very small. Additionally, there is more DIF for longer speaking items and for older examinees, but BERT does not exacerbate these patterns of DIF. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

When human examiners assess L2 learners’ oral fluency, they can consider the effects of different task prompts on speaking performance, systematically adjusting their evaluation criteria across prompts. However, conventional automated scoring methods tend to ignore such variability in speaking performance caused by prompt design and use prompt-specific features of speech. Their robustness is thus arguably limited to a specific prompt used in model training. To address this challenge, we operationalize prompt effects in terms of conceptual, linguistic and phonological features of speech and embed them, as well as a set of temporal features of speech, into a scoring model. We examined the agreement between true and predicted fluency scores in four different L2 English monologue prompts. The proposed method outperformed a conventional method which used only temporal features (κ=0.863vs.0.797 ). The detailed analysis showed that the conceptual and phonological features improved the performance of automated scoring. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the linguistic features was not confirmed possibly because it may largely reflect redundant information to capture the prompt demands. These results suggest that the robustness of the automated fluency scoring should be achieved by careful consideration of what characteristics of L2 speech reflect the prompt effects. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Many automatic speech scoring systems employ an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system to get the speech's transcription, then carry out the other scoring process. The accuracy of the ASR system output, which will be used to calculate the scoring model's features, significantly impacts achieving high scoring accuracy. The National Putonghua Proficiency Test (NPPT) is an official proficiency test in China. The NPPT has four sections: monosyllabic-word reading, multisyllabic-word reading, short text reading, and topic speaking. At present, the topic speaking part still needs to be scored by two certificated human testers. In order to develop an automatic speech scoring system for the NPPT, a robust ASR system is needed. Although the general mandarin ASR systems could also get higher accuracy, most popular general ASR systems have significantly lower performance on the topic of speaking speeches, which contains more mistakes than the general level. This paper builds a speech recognition corpus to develop a specialized ASR for the NPPT topic speaking speech scoring task and adopts the transformer and conformer model to implement the ASR. We also implemented a transfer-learning-based ASR model based on the popular pre-trained Mandarin ASR framework WeNet. The experimental results show that our model could significantly reduce the error rate of lower proficiency speech while achieving higher performance than popular Mandarin ASR systems for general-purpose speech recognition.  © 2022 IEEE.},

ASS systems face many challenges like open grammar, variable pronunciations, and unstructured or semi-structured content. Recent deep learning approaches have shown some promise in this domain. However, most of these approaches focus on extracting features from single audio, making them suffer from the lack of speaker-specific context required to model such a complex task. We propose a novel deep learning technique for non-native ASS, called speaker-conditioned hierarchical modelling. In our technique, we take advantage of the fact that oral proficiency tests rate multiple responses for a candidate. We extract context vectors from these responses and feed them as additional speaker-specific context to our network to score a particular response. We compare our technique with strong baselines and find that such modelling improves the model's average performance by 6.92\% (maximum = 12.86\%, minimum = 4.51\%). We further show both quantitative and qualitative insights into the importance of this additional context in solving the problem of ASS. © 2021 ACM.},

Despite the broad consensus on its multifaceted nature, few researchers have empirically explored the dimensionality of this construct. Operationalizations of fluency vary across research and practice, using both holistic and fine-grained features. To address the dimensionality of speech fluency, in this study we examined an array of fluency features of speaking performances on the Aptis test. We conducted both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses to investigate the relationship between individual fluency features and language proficiency, as well as the relationships among fluency, complexity, and accuracy features. We found differences in the holistic and fine-grained fluency features, suggesting that they might reflect different dimensions of speech fluency and be associated with different components of language proficiency. Based on the findings, we labeled these two types of fluency features as macro and micro fluencies. Whereas macro fluency features tend to entail a holistic representation of fluency, micro fluency features tend to be more closely related to the automatic processing of lexico-grammar, constituting a more direct reflection of the cognitive processes in speech production. The findings support the multidimensionality of speech fluency and the need to include both macro and micro fluency features in the scoring, scale development, and validation of L2 speaking assessment. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {The rapid advances in speech processing and machine learning technologies have attracted language testers’ strong interest in developing automated speaking assessment in which candidate responses are scored by computer algorithms rather than trained human examiners. Despite its increasing popularity, automatic evaluation of spoken language is still shrouded in mystery and technical jargon, often resembling an opaque “black box” that transforms candidate speech to scores in a matter of minutes. Our chapter explicitly problematizes this lack of transparency around test score interpretation and use and asks the following questions: What do automatically derived scores actually mean? What are the speaking constructs underlying them? What are some common problems encountered in automated assessment of speaking? And how can test users evaluate the suitability of automated speaking assessment for their proposed test uses? In addressing these questions, the purpose of our chapter is to explore the benefits, problems, and caveats associated with automated speaking assessment touching on key theoretical discussions on construct representation and score interpretation as well as practical issues such as the infrastructure necessary for capturing high-quality audio and the difficulties associated with acquiring training data. We hope to promote assessment literacy by providing the necessary guidance for users to critically engage with automated speaking assessment, pose the right questions to test developers, and ultimately make informed decisions regarding the fitness for purpose of automated assessment solutions for their specific learning and assessment contexts. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

Such approaches are often difficult to generalize to other languages, especially if we also want to consider suprasegmental qualities such as rhythm. In this work, we examine three different languages that possess distinct rhythm patterns: English (stresstimed), Malay (syllable-timed), and Tamil (mora-timed). We exploit robust feature representations inspired by music processing and vector representation learning. Empirical validations show consistent gains for all three languages when predicting pronunciation, rhythm and intonation performance. Copyright © 2021 ISCA.},

Automatic speech scoring tasks such as reading aloud and spontaneous speech are commonly provided with the prompts in advance to guide test takers' answers, which contain information that should be included in the answers (e.g., listening passage, and sample response). Utilizing these texts to improve ASR performance is of great importance for these tasks. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end (E2E) ASR system incorporating contextual information provided by prompts. Specifically, we add an extra prompt encoder to a transformerbased E2E ASR system. To fuse the probabilities of the ASR output and the prompts dynamically, we train a soft gate based on the pointer network with carefully constructed prompt training corpus. We experiment the proposed method with data collected from English speaking proficiency tests recorded by Chinese teenagers from 16 to 18 years old. The results show the improved performance of speech recognition with a nearly 50\% drop in word error rate (WER) utilizing prompts. Furthermore, the proposed network performs well in rare word recognition such as locations and personal names.  Copyright © 2021 ISCA.},

There is one type of test question widely used in speaking assessment, which requires test takers to first listen to and/or read stimulus material and then create a spontaneous response to a question related to the stimulus. In a high-proficiency response, critical content from the stimulus - referred to as 'key points' - should be properly covered. We propose Transformer-based models to automatically detect the location of key point spans within a response, or if no key points are covered, to detect their absence. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task learning approach for assigning a 'quality score' to each key point span, measuring how well the key point is rendered within the response. Experimental results demonstrate that the pro-posed models can surpass human expert performance based on human transcriptions. In contrast, based on automatic speech recognition hypotheses, models underperform human expert performance with an F1-score at 66.6\% (vs. human agreement of 68.8\%) on span detection and a Pearson corre-lation coefficient at 0.579 (vs. human agreement of 0.610) on quality score prediction. © 2021 IEEE.},

Moreover, a new negative sampling method is proposed to augment training data.

Based on this, this dissertation uses the speech recognition technology based on fuzzy measure to evaluate the spoken English. In the study the fuzzy measure, based on the traditional algorithm, is used to evaluate the spoken English and different characteristic parameters are extracted to construct the corresponding evaluation model. Simultaneously, the pronunciation is evaluated through automatic learning rules. The English speaking assessment model based on fuzzy measure and speech recognition technology is constructed and validated. The research shows that compared with the traditional algorithms, the spoken language evaluation algorithm based on fuzzy measure and speech recognition technology has the incomparable superiority, and can provide a reference for the follow-up related research.

We focus on one type of test question widely used in speaking assessment where test takers are required to first listen to and/or read stimulus material and then create a spontaneous response to a question related to the stimulus. In a high-proficiency response, critical content from the source material - referred to as “key points” - should be properly covered. We propose Transformer-based models to automatically detect absent key points or location spans of key points present in a response. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-task learning approach to measure how well a key point is rendered within a response (quality score). Experimental results show that automatic models can surpass human expert performance on both tasks: for span detection, the system performance reached an F1 score of 74.5\% (vs. human agreement of 68.3\%); for quality score prediction, system performance reached a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.744 (vs. human agreement of 0.712). Finally, the proposed key point-based features can be used to predict speaking proficiency scores with a correlation of 0.730. © 2020 International Speech Communication Association.

Its main focus is related to the automated scoring of spontaneous speech elicited by TOEFL iBT Speaking section items, but other applications of speech scoring, such as for more predictable spoken responses or responses provided in a dialogic setting, are also discussed. The book begins with an in-depth overview of the nascent field of automated speech scoring-its history, applications, and challenges-followed by a discussion of psychometric considerations for automated speech scoring. The second and third parts discuss the integral main components of an automated speech scoring system as well as the different types of automatically generated measures extracted by the system features related to evaluate the speaking construct of communicative competence as measured defined by the TOEFL iBT Speaking assessment. Finally, the last part of the book touches on more recent developments, such as providing more detailed feedback on test takers' spoken responses using speech features and scoring of dialogic speech. It concludes with a discussion, summary, and outlook on future developments in this area. Written with minimal technical details for the benefit of non-experts, this book is an ideal resource for graduate students in courses on Language Testing and Assessment as well as teachers and researchers in applied linguistics. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Klaus Zechner and Keelan Evanini; individual chapters, the contributors.},

In SpeechRater, different features are designed to correspond to different aspects of linguistic performance, such as pronunciation, vocabulary sophistication, and overall fluency, in addition to others. With multiple construct-relevant features available, there are two important decisions involved in the SpeechRater scoring model design process: what features should be used in the final model and what weight should be assigned to each feature.

Automated speech scoring can be situated within the broader context of automated scoring applications in general. The idea to use automatically extracted features for scoring a test-taker’s constructed response was first proposed by E. B. Page in the context of automated essay scoring.

Similar to the automated scoring of open-ended text responses, automated scoring of free-form spoken responses has certain advantages over human scoring. Compared to human scoring, automated scoring can facilitate near-instant score turnaround and give detailed, potentially diagnostic, performance feedback, as discussed in M. Zhang. Given the abundance of existing literature and frameworks, people do not intend to propose yet another framework. Instead, based on the study of existing literature, they choose to emphasize two important aspects of validation that are commonly called for by investigators, developers, and users.

The experiments were first conducted on a large data set drawn from an operational English proficiency assessment across multiple years, and the best classifier on this heavily imbalanced data set resulted in an F1-score of 0.761 on the plagiarized class. This system was then validated on operational responses collected from a single administration of the assessment and achieved a recall of 0.897.

This study aims to address this problem by building an automatic system to detect off-topic spoken responses which can inform the downstream automated scoring pipeline. We propose an innovative method to interpret the comparison between a test response and the question used to elicit it as a similarity grid, and then apply very deep convolutional neural networks to determine different degrees of topic relevance. In this study, Inception networks were applied to this task, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our system achieves an F1-score of 92.8\% on the class of off-topic responses, which significantly outperforms a baseline system using a range of word embedding-based similarity metrics (F1-score = 85.5\%).

While SDS-based speaking tasks have the potential to improve automated assessment systems by eliciting more authentic speech and opening up ability to assess aspects of the speaking construct that are not covered by monologic speaking tasks, there are many challenges associated with introducing them into consequential assessments.

In order to develop an automated scoring system that is robust to these atypical responses, we first developed a set of content features to capture content abnormalities. Next, we trained scoring models using the augmented training dataset, including synthetic atypical responses.

Despite the general consensus among language researchers that collocation is essential to effective language use in real-world communication, particularly oral communication, language-testing researchers have made little attempt to evaluate this language phenomenon in second language (L2) spoken discourse, nor is it common practice for speaking assessment criteria to embrace the concept. Following a review of three contemporary speech-processing theories and a logical analysis of the relationship between collocation and speech formulation, this article proposes a new construct called “spoken collocational competence” (SCC) to account for the observed collocation usage in naturally occurring L2 speech. It is suggested that SCC be measured in three dimensions (i.e., accuracy, complexity, and fluency), and empirical evidence for this construct is presented. Finally, the implications of SCC for automated speech evaluation are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor \& Francis.},

Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) has been commonly used in the analysis of discourse organization of written texts; however, limited research has been conducted to date on RST annotation and parsing of spoken language, in particular, non-native spontaneous speech. Due to the fact that the measurement of discourse coherence is typically a key metric in human scoring rubrics for assessments of spoken language, we initiated a research to first obtain RST annotations on non-native spoken responses from a standardized assessment of academic English proficiency. Afterwards, based on the annotations obtained, automatic parsers were built to process non-native spontaneous speech. Finally, a set of effective features were extracted from both manually annotated and automatically generated RST trees to evaluate the discourse structure of non-native spontaneous speech, and then employed to further improve the validity of an automated speech scoring system. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Automated scoring engines are usually trained and evaluated against human scores and compared to the benchmark of human-human agreement. In this paper we compare the performance of an automated speech scoring engine using two corpora: a corpus of almost 700,000 randomly sampled spoken responses with scores assigned by one or two raters during operational scoring, and a corpus of 16,500 exemplar responses with scores reviewed by multiple expert raters. We show that the choice of corpus used for model evaluation has a major effect on estimates of system performance with r varying between 0.64 and 0.80. Surprisingly, this is not the case for the choice of corpus for model training: when the training corpus is sufficiently large, the systems trained on different corpora showed almost identical performance when evaluated on the same corpus. We show that this effect is consistent across several learning algorithms. We conclude that evaluating the model on a corpus of exemplar responses if one is available provides additional evidence about system validity; at the same time, investing effort into creating a corpus of exemplar responses for model training is unlikely to lead to a substantial gain in model performance. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics},

	abstract = {In this study, we propose an efficient way to combine human and automated scoring to increase the reliability and validity of a system used to assess spoken responses in the context of an international English language assessment. A set of filtering systems are used to automatically identify various classes of spoken responses that are difficult to score with an automated scoring system, for example, due to a high level of noise or imperfections in components of the overall system. Finally, these flagged responses are then routed to and scored by human raters. The vast majority of responses are not flagged by the filtering system and receive scores by the automated scoring system, resulting in a hybrid scoring approach. The overall hybrid speech scoring system presented here is comprised of multiple subprocesses, including the recording of spoken responses, transcription generation based on an automated speech recognizer, linguistic feature generation, filtering of problematic responses, automated score generation, human rater scoring, and final score combination. We evaluate this scoring approach with pilot data from a novel international English proficiency assessment. It achieves a substantial improvement in scoring performance and score validity with a limited amount of human scoring and most responses scored automatically; the correlation between the baseline system (baseline filtering with imputation) with human raters’ scores is 0.72, and using an extended filtering model, the performance improves to 0.82. The improvement can be attributed in part to the extended filtering model itself that identified more classes of non-scorable responses, and in part to the combination of machine and human scores in our hybrid system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The description of speech and some of its core features is based on the 1.8-million-word Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE) and on the 10-million-word spoken component of the British National Corpus (BNC). Analyses of word frequency and keyword lists are followed by an automatic extraction of different types of phraseological items that are particularly common in speech and serve important communicative functions. These corpus explorations provide evidence for the strong interconnectedness of lexical items and grammatical structures in natural language. Based on the assumption that the existence of lexicogrammatical patterns is of relevance for constructs of speaking tests, the paper then reviews rubrics of popular high-stakes speaking tests and critically discusses how far these rubrics capture the central aspects of spoken language identified in the corpus analyses as well as the centrality of phraseology in language. It closes with recommendations for speaking assessment in the light of this characterization of real-world spoken lexicogrammar. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

Although the measurement of discourse coherence is typically a key metric in human scoring rubrics for assessments of spontaneous spoken language, little prior research has been done to assess a speaker’s coherence in the context of automated speech scoring. To address this, we first present a corpus of spoken responses drawn from an assessment of English proficiency that has been annotated for discourse coherence. When adding these discourse annotations as features to an automated speech scoring system, the accuracy in predicting human proficiency scores is improved by 7.8\% relative, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of including coherence information in the task of automated scoring of spontaneous speech. We further investigate the use of two different sets of features to automatically model the coherence quality of spontaneous speech, including a set of features originally designed to measure text complexity and a set of surface-based features describing the speaker’s use of nouns, pronouns, conjunctions, and discourse connectives in the spoken response. Additional experiments demonstrate that an automated speech scoring system can benefit from coherence scores that are generated automatically using these feature sets. © 2017 7th ISCA Workshop on Speech and Language Technology in Education, SLaTE 2017.

The evaluation results show that the both deep learning systems significantly outperform the GMM ASR. These ASR systems are used as the front-end in building an automated speech scoring system. To examine the effectiveness of the deep learning ASR systems for automated scoring, another non-native spontaneous speech corpus is used to train and evaluate the scoring models. Using deep learning architectures, ASR accuracies drop significantly on the scoring corpus, whereas the performance of the scoring systems get closer to human raters, and consistently better than the GMM one. Compared to the DNN ASR, the Tandem performs slightly better on the scoring speech while it is a little less accurate on the ASR evaluation dataset. Furthermore, given the results of the improved scoring performance while using fewer scoring features, the Tandem system shows more robustness for scoring task than the DNN one. © 2016 IEEE.},

We use a type of recurrent neural network to jointly optimize the learning of high level abstractions from time-sequence features with the time-aggregated features. We first automatically learn high level abstractions from time-sequence features with a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM) and then combine the high level abstractions with time-aggregated features in a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)/Linear Regression (LR). We optimize the BLSTM and the MLP/LR jointly. We find such models reach the best performance in terms of correlation with human raters.

	abstract = {When applying automated speech-scoring technology to the rating of globally administered real assessments, there are several practical challenges: (a) ASR accuracy on non-native spontaneous speech is generally low; (b) due to the data mismatch between an ASR systems training stage and its final usage, the recognition accuracy obtained in practice is even lower; (c) content-relevance was not widely used in the scoring models in operation due to various technical and logistical issues. For this paper, an ASR in a deep neural network (DNN) architecture of multi-splice with iVectors was trained and resulted in a performance at 19:1\% word error rate (WER). Secondly, we applied language model (LM) adaptation for the prompts that were not covered in ASR training by using the spoken responses acquired from previous operational tests, and we were able to reduce the relative WER by more than 8\%. The boosted ASR performance improves the scoring performance without any extra human annotation cost. Finally, the developed ASR system allowed us to apply content features in practice. Besides the conventional frequency-based approach, content vector analysis (CVA), we also explored distributed representations with Doc2Vec and found an improvement on content measurement.

	abstract = {Automated assessment of language proficiency of a test taker's spoken response regarding its content, vocabulary, grammar and context depends largely upon how well the input speech can be recognized. While state-of-the-art, deep neural net based acoustic models have significantly improved the recognition performance of native speaker's speech, good recognition is still challenging when the input speech consists of non-native spontaneous utterances. In this paper, we investigate how to train a DNN based ASR with a fairly large non-native English corpus and make it self-adaptive to a test speaker and a new task, namely a simulated conversation, which is different from them monologic speech in the training data. Automated assessment of language proficiency is evaluated according to both task completion (TC) and pragmatic competence (PC) rubrics. Experimental results show that self-adaptive DNNs trained with i-vectors can reduce absolute word error rate by 11.7\% and deliver more accurate recognized word sequences for language proficiency assessment. Also, the recognition accuracy gain translates into a gain of automatic assessment performance on the test data. The correlations between automated scoring and expert scoring could be increased by 0.07 (TC) and 0.15 (PC), respectively. Copyright © 2016 ISCA.},

	abstract = {This study develops an oral evaluation system of voice skills in English public speech passages and examines the system's robustness. The system builds on four methods: 1) creation of customized oral practice system on the cloud; 2) automatic speech-text alignment; 3) pause detection; and 4) English speech scoring. The system was made available as a web application and was able to rate the vocal expressiveness and pronunciation correctness of the users' public speech recordings. The application gave instant feedbacks of scores of pronunciation, duration, and intonation on the word level as well as a score indicating the overall performance of the speech passage. The system and a human judge rated sixty students' oral public speech recordings respectively and produced two sets of scores. A paired t-test was executed on the two sets of scores to verify the robustness of the system. The result shows that the two ratings are not significantly different. It means that the automatic system can be an alternative to the manual scoring of a human judge in distance learning. In conclusion, the system can serve as an additional evaluative aid for teachers and self-evaluation aid for English public speech learners. The success of the application implies that it may be possible for researchers to further develop the system for different language settings and ultimately becomes a multilingual evaluative tool. © 2016, the author(s).},

	abstract = {Body language plays an important role in learning processes and communication. For example, communication research produced evidence that mathematical knowledge can be embodied in gestures made by teachers and students. Likewise, body postures and gestures are also utilized by speakers in oral presentations to convey ideas and important messages. Consequently, capturing and analyzing non-verbal behaviors is an important aspect in multimodal learning analytics (MLA) research. With regard to sensing capabilities, the introduction of depth sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect has greatly facilitated research and development in this area. However, the rapid advancement in hardware and software capabilities is not always in sync with the expanding set of features reported in the literature. For example, though Anvil [21] is a widely used state-of-the-art annotation and visualization toolkit for motion traces, its motion recording component based on OpenNI is outdated. As part of our research in developing multimodal educational assessments, we began an effort to develop and standardize algorithms for purposes of multimodal feature extraction and creating automated scoring models. This paper provides an overview of relevant work in multimodal research on educational tasks, and proceeds to summarize our work using multimodal sensors in developing assessments of communication skills, with attention on the use of depth sensors. Specifically, we focus on the task of public speaking assessment using Microsoft Kinect. Additionally, we introduce an open-source Python package for computing expressive body language features from Kinect motion data, which we hope will benefit the MLA research community. © 2015 ACM.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.specom.2014.09.005},
	abstract = {Expanding paradigms of language learning and testing prompt the need for developing objective methods of assessing language proficiency from spontaneous speech. In this paper new measures of syntactic complexity for use in the framework of automatic scoring systems for second language spontaneous speech, are studied. In contrast to most existing measures that estimate competence levels indirectly based on the length of production units or frequency of specific grammatical structures, we capture the differences in the distribution of morpho-syntactic features across learners' proficiency levels. We build score-specific models of part of speech (POS) tag distribution from a large corpus of spontaneous second language English utterances and use them to measure syntactic complexity. Given a speaker's response, we consider its similarity with a set of utterances scored for proficiency by humans. The comparison is made by considering the distribution of POS tags in the response and a score-level. The underlying distribution of POS tags (indicative of syntactic complexity) is represented via two models: a vector-space model and a language model. Empirical results suggest that the proposed measures of syntactic complexity show a reasonable association with human-rated proficiency scores compared to conventional measures of syntactic complexity. They are also significantly robust against errors resulting from automatic speech recognition, making them more suitable for use in operational automated scoring applications. When used in combination with other measures of oral proficiency in a state-of-the-art scoring model, the predicted scores show improved agreement with human-assigned scores over a baseline scoring model without our proposed features. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The provision of feedback remains one of the most potent instructional interventions within second language acquisition, yet the affective mechanisms underlying its efficacy are still poorly understood. This study investigates how feedback type, specifically AI-generated versus teacher-provided feedback, interacts with learners' Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEI) and Foreign Language Enjoyment (FLE) to influence language proficiency development. Adopting a quasi-experimental design with a purely quantitative methodological orientation, the research recruited 63 intermediate-level English as a Second Language (ESL) learners and assigned them randomly to either an AI feedback group or a teacher feedback group. Participants completed five academic writing and speaking tasks over six weeks, each followed by an immediate feedback and revision cycle. Measurements included pre- and post-intervention language proficiency assessments, alongside the administration of validated scales for TEI and FLE. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to examine both direct and mediated pathways between variables. Results revealed that TEI significantly predicted learners' levels of FLE, which, in turn, significantly mediated the relationship between feedback type and language proficiency improvement. Teacher feedback demonstrated a stronger positive effect on FLE compared to AI feedback. The SEM model exhibited excellent fit indices, confirming the robustness of the hypothesized structure. These findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional dimensions in feedback practices, suggesting that optimal language learning outcomes arise not merely from the cognitive correction of errors but also from the emotional resonance that feedback generates. Implications are discussed for pedagogical practices, AI design in language education, and the broader field of affective second language acquisition research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using a mixed-methods approach, the study conducted quantitative assessments of pronunciation ability and speaking anxiety, while qualitatively exploring learners' experiences with Gen-AI feedback through in-depth interviews. Findings suggest that learners experienced improvements in pronunciation ability and reductions in FL speaking anxiety, which coincided with increased self-directed motivation and social interaction confidence. Gen-AI's real-time personalized feedback facilitated learners' identification and correction of pronunciation issues, alongside reduced anxiety and increased confidence. When combined with emotional support from teachers and peers, Gen-AI use appeared to foster both technical development and affective growth, underscoring the importance of a balanced learning environment for sustained learning. Learners also reported greater willingness to engage in authentic communication activities, such as conversations with native speakers and group discussions, suggesting potential for community formation. The findings indicate that Gen-AI may support both individual achievement and learning community formation.

	abstract = {This research examines the impact of integrating generative AI (ChatGPT) on 93 Thai university students‘English communication skills and their perceptions of AI integration. Initially, the students completed a video-recorded conversation simulation on a predetermined topic to be assessed using a scoring rubric, representing their pre-simulation performance. Subsequently, the students engaged in structured instruction. They collaborated in small groups with ChatGPT to create conversation scripts on the same topic, which they later used for post-simulation video recordings, representing the post-simulation performance. A focus group discussion with ten randomly selected participants was conducted to explore the students‘perceptions. A comparison of pre- and post-simulation scores revealed significant improvements, particularly in fluency, vocabulary usage, and overall communication skills. Additionally, focus group findings indicated highly positive sentiments about ChatGPT, emphasizing its role in reducing anxiety, promoting creativity and enthusiasm, and enhancing the interactivity and enjoyment of language learning. This study underscores ChatGPT‘s potential as a valuable resource in language education, particularly when combined with teacher support and oversight. By generating scripts grounded in sound pedagogical principles, AI creates an interactive environment for enhancing conversational English, fostering active engagement, and meeting students‘diverse learning needs. Although the findings are promising, the research highlights the necessity of aligning AI implementation with pedagogical principles to guarantee valuable learning experiences. This research contributes to the expanding field of literature on AI in education, offering insights into how tools like ChatGPT can enhance communication abilities and prepare students for real-world applications in academic and professional contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As chatbots evolve from scripted responders to reasoning companions, their role in language education is rapidly shifting. Yet, while their presence is expanding, a deeper understanding of how they interact—not just respond—with learners remains elusive. This systematic review repositions interaction as the core of chatbot-assisted language learning, drawing on 100 peer-reviewed studies published between 2009 and 2024. Through a three-phase grounded coding approach to extract and synthesize these literature, we identify four distinct interaction styles, such as interlocutor, narrator, entertainer, and facilitator, each shaping engagement across pedagogical, affective, and cognitive domains. We find that large language models (LLMs) have broadened the educational affordances of chatbots, particularly in writing, speaking, and emotional support. However, their potential to foster higher-order thinking remains largely untapped. Limitations such as hallucination, bias, and ethical risks are seldom addressed in practice, underscoring the need for more critical integration. We argue that effective use depends not only on technological sophistication, but on prompt design, emotional connection, and teachers as ethical gatekeepers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The development of AI technology has brought new opportunities for impromptu speaking instruction. Therefore, this study proposes an AI-supported interleaved training strategy that focuses on the effects on students’ impromptu speaking performance, learning engagement, technology acceptance, and epistemic network structure. A quasi-experimental study was conducted at a university in southern China to assess the effectiveness of this strategy. The experimental group (EG, N = 26) used the AI-supported interleaved training strategy, whereas the control group (CG, N = 26) used the Teacher-supported interleaved training strategy. The results of the study showed that students in EG not only improved their impromptu speaking performance but also improved their learning engagement. The results also found that students’ learning engagement could effectively predict impromptu speaking performance, while technology acceptance could produce a mediating effect on impromptu speaking performance. Meanwhile, the results of the ENA indicated that the connection relation in the epistemic network of EG was better than that of CG overall. This result illustrates the effectiveness of AI technology in aiding impromptu speaking instruction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Generative AI (GAI) and AI-generated content (AIGC) have been increasingly involved in our work and daily life, providing a new learning experience for students. This study examines whether AI-generated instructional videos (AIIV) can facilitate learning as effectively as traditional recorded videos (RV). We propose an instructional video generation pipeline that includes customized GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), text-to-speech and lip synthesis techniques to generate videos from slides and a clip or a photo of a human instructor. Seventy-six students were randomly assigned to learn English words using either AIIV or RV, with performance assessed by retention, transfer and subjective measures from cognitive, emotional, motivational and social perspectives. The findings indicate that the AIIV group performed as well as the RV group in facilitating learning, with AIIV showing higher retention but no significant differences in transfer. RV was found to offer a stronger sense of social presence. Although other subjective measures were similar between the two groups, AIIV was perceived as slightly less favourable. However, the AIIV was still found to be moderately to highly attractive, addressing concerns related to the uncanny valley effect. This research demonstrates that AIGC can be an effective tool for learning, offering valuable implications for the use of GAI in educational settings. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Instructional videos, especially those featuring a teacher's presence, have been widely used in second language learning to facilitate learning. Producing instructional videos is costly and burdensome. Generative AI has great potential for generating educational content. What this paper adds An AI-generated instructional video (including generated lecture text, voice and appearance) demonstrated greater improvement in students' retention performance in English word learning than a traditional recorded video. Students perceived no significant differences between the AI-generated instructional video and recorded video in satisfaction, motivation, trust, cognitive load, emotions and parasocial interaction dimensions, although the AI-generated instructional video group reported slightly lower values. Despite AI-generated instructional video eliciting a significantly lower value of social presence than recorded video, it led to a reduction in cognitive load and better performance. Implications for practice and/or policy We recommend using the AI-generated instructional video in both physical and online classes for its positive effects on both learning achievement and learning experience. The findings indicate the equivalence principle in AI-generated content, highlighting that the appearance, voice and lecture text generated by current AI technology have reached a certain level of quality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study examines the production of Voice Onset Time (VOT) in English stop consonants by native speakers of American English and Arabic-speaking English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners at two proficiency levels. VOT, an acoustic parameter, is an essential feature in distinguishing between voiced and voiceless stops. Drawing on Flege’s Speech Learning Model (SLM), the research investigates whether learners differentiate between voiceless and voiced stops (/p/ vs. /b/) and apply appropriate aspiration in /sp/ clusters, and whether proficiency influences VOT patterns. Data were collected from 29 native English speakers and 58 Arabic-speaking learners, who produced minimal pairs and /sp/ cluster words embedded in carrier sentences. All tokens were annotated manually in Praat and analyzed using linear mixed effects models. Results showed that native speakers maintained robust VOT distinctions, while Novice-High learners exhibited overlapping distributions between /p/ and /b/ and inappropriate aspiration in clusters. Intermediate- High learners produced more target-like patterns, suggesting early stages of L2 category formation. Findings support the SLM’s predictions and underscore the need for explicit instruction on VOT contrasts and improvements in AI-assisted pronunciation feedback tools. The study concludes with some pedagogical implications for pronunciation instruction. For example, teachers working with Arabic-speaking learners should highlight the role of aspiration in English voicing contrasts and explicitly address its absence in /sp/ clusters. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized several domains, with language acquisition being one of its most significant areas of influence. The capacity of AI to customize learning, provide immediate feedback, and dismantle conventional obstacles to education has transformed language acquisition for global learners. AI-driven services like as Duolingo, Babbel, and Google Translate use techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, voice recognition, and virtual instructors to provide dynamic, interactive, and immersive learning environments. These technologies allow learners to practice language skills at their own speed, get rapid feedback, and customize their learning trajectories according to their progress. The influence of AI is notably profound in enhancing the four essential language skills - reading, writing, speaking, and listening - by providing individualized and adaptive learning experiences that are sometimes absent in conventional classroom environments. Moreover, AI's function beyond the enhancement of language proficiency in predominant languages; it is also used to conserve and advocate for endangered languages, providing platforms for learners to interact with less typically taught languages such as Hawaiian and Navajo. AI-driven translation tools, such as Google Translate and Microsoft Translator, are enhancing cross-cultural communication and dismantling language obstacles, demonstrating their use in fields including international commerce, diplomacy, and tourism. Nonetheless, the rapid incorporation of AI in language acquisition presents obstacles. Challenges such excessive dependence on technology, the inadequacies of AI in conveying cultural subtleties, issues over data privacy, and the digital gap, especially in poor areas, need attention. Moreover, while AI may improve the technical aspects of language acquisition, it is inadequate in imparting the cultural context vital for genuine language proficiency. It is essential to balance AI use with human engagement while addressing ethical and accessibility issues to ensure that AI-driven language instruction is successful and fair. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of chatbots based on artificial intelligence (AI) for teaching the Ukrainian language was considered highly relevant in the context of the digitalization of education and the increasing demand to make students’ speech development more effective. Interactive tools were found to engage students more actively in the learning process, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that often failed to accommodate individual learners’ needs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of AI-based chatbots on the development of speech competencies among secondary school students. The methodology included a questionnaire survey of students, a pedagogical experiment involving chatbot-assisted learning, comparative analysis of learning outcomes between the control group (CG) and the experimental group (EG), and systematic observation of speaking activity. The study confirmed that the use of chatbots significantly improved students’ speaking skills, increased their motivation, and enhanced lesson interactivity. Specifically, the EG students demonstrated a 27\% improvement in productive speech performance and a 35\% increase in the number of speech acts. In comparison, the CG showed only a 12\% increase in productivity and a 9\% rise in speech acts, which was notably lower than the EG results. The conclusions highlighted that the integration of chatbots contributed to the development of sustainable communicative skills and supported students’ motivation to learn. Teachers acknowledged the pedagogical potential of such tools but also emphasized the need for additional training and improved technical infrastructure. The academic novelty of the research lay in the development of an interactive methodology for teaching Ukrainian, which effectively combined traditional practices with innovative approaches such as personalization and gamification. The practical value consisted in the applicability of the results for improving Ukrainian language instruction, guiding the integration of AI tools into curricula, and enhancing teacher qualifications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

AI has opened up new pathways for language skills development, student engagement, and learner autonomy through innovative technologies amidst the digital transformation in education. The study adopted a mixed-methods approach consisting of a quantitative survey with 106 students and qualitative interviews with 10 of these students to explore the findings more deeply. The questionnaire captured perceptions regarding the usefulness, ease of use, and social influence of AI, while the interviews revealed students’ experiences and motivations in detail. The analysis showed that specific AI tools, particularly grammar checkers, text-to-speech programs, and language learning apps, were valuable and easy to use, enhancing students’ confidence and performance. However, social influence from peers and instructors was minimal. While the quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed independently, their integration in the discussion revealed points of alignment and disagreement between the two strands. The findings suggest the need for institutional policies aimed at responsible AI adoption and the enhancement of teacher preparedness as well as student education on the shortcomings of AI. This study provides practical benefits to educators and policymakers, while being grounded in the widely accepted technology acceptance model, offering theoretical contributions. Reliance on self-reported data and a limited field of study are some shortcomings.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed language learning approaches and outcomes. However, research on AI-assisted English for Academic Purposes (EAP) speaking classrooms remains sparse. This study evaluates "EAP Talk", an AI-assisted speaking assessment tool, examining its effectiveness in two contexts: controlled tasks (Reading Aloud) that elicit non-spontaneous speech, and uncontrolled tasks (Presentation) that generate spontaneous speech. The research assessed accuracy and validity of EAP Talk scores through analysing 20 Reading Aloud and 20 Presentation recordings randomly selected from a pool of 64 undergraduate students. These recordings were graded by five experienced EAP teachers using Adaptive Comparative Judgment (ACJ) – a comparative scoring method – and the traditional rubric rating approach. Acknowledging the limitation of EAP Talk in providing scores without detailed feedback, the study further investigated its perceived validity and examined oral peer feedback as a complementary enhancement strategy. Semi-structured interviews with four students were conducted to investigate their perceptions of the AI-assisted assessment process, focusing on the benefits of EAP Talk in enhancing learning, its limitations, and the effectiveness of oral peer feedback. Scoring concordance analysis shows that EAP Talk performs well in the controlled task but less so in the uncontrolled one. Content analysis on the interview data reveals that EAP Talk facilitates student confidence and positively shapes learning styles, while oral peer feedback markedly improves speaking skills through effective human-computer collaboration. The study calls for more precise AI assessments in uncontrolled tasks and proposes pedagogical strategies to better integrate AI into EAP speaking contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The rise of intelligent chatbots powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning has ignited interest in their potential for revolutionising second language (L2) acquisition and foreign language learning (FLL). While their potential seems vast, understanding their actual impact on learning outcomes requires comprehensive analysis. Also required is the continuous evaluation of this technology due to the rapid pace of advancements in chatbots, highlighting the need for a fresh look using the latest research. This systematic review aims to address this need by investigating the effectiveness of modern chatbots in L2 learning and FLL, offering valuable insights for language educators and researchers. Objectives: This study systematically reviews existing research to assess the usefulness of chatbots in L2 acquisition and FLL, identifying key areas of improvement and future research directions. Methods: Following the PRISMA methodology, 33 relevant studies published between 2020 and May 2024 were analysed. Thematic analysis was employed to identify key themes related to chatbot applications, language skills impacted, and learning outcomes achieved. Results: The findings clearly reveal specific language skills (i.e., speaking) and language knowledge (i.e., vocabulary) that have a significant impact on enhancing students' learning outcomes by using chatbots, while pointing out insufficient research in this area. The results also show major benefits of chatbots for FLL, such as individualised learning, immediate feedback, enhancing willingness to communicate, and increased interaction. Conclusions: This systematic review highlights specific practical implications and suggestions that have a direct impact on the usefulness of chatbots in FLL and L2 acquisition, and a need to investigate further variables such as age, language skills, personality traits, or teacher's role with respect to the use of chatbots in foreign language classes. Further implications are also raised in terms of learning design considerations when such a technology is incorporated in the FLL classroom. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It examines the practices, views and challenges of students who are aiming to improve their spoken communication skills with the chatbot in the conventional language classroom. Method: Based on a small-scale study conducted at universities in Japan, this research employs both qualitative and quantitative questionnaire-based surveys to examine students’ attitudes and views on engaging in simulated real conversations using a chatbot for a period of eight weeks in an English language course. Particular attention was also paid to examining the differences between experienced and novice chatbot users’ first-hand experiences of speaking intervention tasks. Results: The findings revealed that students had positive views on the chatbot-facilitated intervention in the classroom, but they were shaped by the socio-educational norms and practices that they were accustomed to and their expectations informed by their prior experiences. Their views were also influenced by their previous utility of such AI technology. Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into how to effectively utilise a chatbot as an educational tool to help students personalise language learning experiences in diverse social and educational contexts. Teachers need to be equipped with the knowledge that students’ socio-educational backgrounds and their language learning approaches are inseparable and indistinguishable. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Traditionally it was the job of a teacher, however, with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) this task has become automated. This study evaluated the efficacy of AI-generated feedback provided by the SmallTalk2Me platform for improving speaking skill among Saudi EFL learners. Forty-four Saudi EFL learners participated in this quasi-experimental study. The data were derived from the IELTS speaking pre-test and post-test, while in between, the participants completed six practice activities over a period of three weeks (two activities each week). Two data sets were compiled: IELTS speaking band scores and proficiency (measured by words spoken per minute). The data were analyzed using paired t-tests to evaluate statistical significance. The study hypothesized that learners would achieve a higher mean score in the IELTS speaking post-test after completing language practices on SmallTalk2Me. This hypothesis was statistically supported, as the difference between the pre-test and post-test mean scores was significant (p {\textless} 0.05). The learners demonstrated a 12.12\% improvement in their IELTS speaking test band scores, while an 11.18\% increase was observed in their speaking proficiency between the first and the sixth practice activities. Following the intervention, a 25-item questionnaire was administered to evaluate the participants’ perception of AI-generated feedback, the efficacy of SmallTalk2Me, and the overall learning experience. Students found AI-generated feedback effective, motivating, and engaging. The study highlights the efficacy of AI-generated feedback provided by SmallTalk2Me and recommends the use of such AI platforms in the Saudi EFL scenario. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Few systematic review research specifically explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) speaking instruction in Asian higher education. Given current research trends, AI-based instruction is receiving increasing attention for its potential to enhance language learning. Therefore, this review aims to trace the trend of empirical research on integrating AI in EFL speaking instruction between 2018 and 2024 in Asia. Using the PRISMA systematic review protocol, this paper analyzed 21 studies on AI-integrated EFL speaking instruction, exploring trends, AI tools, integrating instructional methods, and the challenges between 2018 and 2024. This research finds that since 2022, research on integrating AI in EFL speaking instruction in higher education has increased significantly, mainly in East Asia, and the research methods are primarily quantitative studies. AI chatbots, apps, and platforms are predominantly seen in EFL speaking instruction and AI virtual human teachers have the potential to be applied in oral English classrooms. Task-based learning shows the greatest potential method for integrating AI into English-speaking instruction. However, several challenges hinder the full adoption of AI in EFL curricula, highlighting gaps in empirical research. This review contributes to the discourse on AI-enhanced EFL instruction by offering new insights into existing practices, identifying research gaps, and emphasizing the need for more effective AI tools and instructional methods in Asian higher education. The study underscores the importance of experimental and qualitative research to refine AI-based pedagogical strategies and enhance EFL learners’ speaking proficiency in tertiary education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While much previous research has focused on the combined effects of AIIS in facilitating interactions with teachers, learner peers, and content in higher education, this study specifically examined the discrete effects of AIIS on secondary students’ speaking performance, goal setting, self-evaluation, and motivation, and the developmental trend of goal setting, self-evaluation, and motivation in IDLE. Sixty secondary students were assigned into the treatment group of interacting with AIIS and the control group of observing fixed scaffolding over ten sessions in IDLE. Results indicated that the treatment group showed more learning gains in vocabulary, goal setting, self-evaluation, and motivation than the control group. Moreover, despite the similar decline and rise developmental trajectories of goal setting, self-evaluation, and motivation, the treatment group dropped less in the middle of the sessions. This study adds to the scarce evidence that AIIS facilitates secondary students’ speaking learning in IDLE and provides theoretical, pedagogical, and research implications for AI-supported interactive learning environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Courses: English as Second Language (ESL), English Conversation, English Comprehension, and any courses in which groups of L2 students are present. Objectives: L2 students will be able to perform complex, unfamiliar ESL comprehension tasks with confidence and clarity of direction. Instructors will be able to transfer this strategy to other tasks and communicate objectives and directions to their L2 students more clearly in the students' L1.

Focusing on conversational skills development—a domain requiring balanced attention to meaning-focused input/output, language-focused learning, and fluency—the research addresses a critical gap in material design for technology-mediated flipped instruction. Employing a qualitative case study methodology, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with six Indonesian EFL teachers at the tertiary level. Data analysis revealed a four-phase pedagogical model wherein AI tools were systematically deployed to: (1) scaffold meaning-focused input (e.g., AI-generated transcriptions, text adaptation), (2) reinforce language-focused learning (e.g., grammar/vocabulary feedback systems), (3) facilitate meaning-focused output (e.g., conversational AI prompts), and (4) enhance fluency development (e.g., adaptive speaking drills). Key challenges emerged regarding AI’s limitations in contextual appropriateness, feedback reliability, and the risk of pedagogical fragmentation, necessitating teacher mediation to preserve theoretical fidelity. The study contributes to literature on flipped learning by demonstrating how AI can operationalize SLA principles while affirming educators’ central role in curricular decision-making. Practical implications for instructional design and teacher professional development are discussed, alongside recommendations for future research on AI’s efficacy across diverse institutional contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Advancements in computer technology and speech signal processing have driven the development of English pronunciation learning systems, particularly in applications involving artificial intelligence and remote education. This study focuses on a text-dependent English pronunciation learning system that leverages the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for precise speaker identification and pronunciation improvement. By extracting speech features using advanced techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Cepstrum (CEPST), and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the system captures perceptually relevant characteristics of speech, mirroring human auditory processing. The GMM algorithm uses these features to construct robust speaker models, with the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) probability method applied to match test speech data with stored models, achieving a high similarity rate exceeding 93\%. The system integrates iterative learning, employing multi-stage voice recording, teacher feedback, and self-assessment to guide students in refining their pronunciation. Experimental results show that optimizing Gaussian components and feature dimensions significantly enhances accuracy. This paper emphasizes the system's role in providing objective, data-driven evaluations, enabling teachers to offer precise feedback while empowering students with tools for independent learning. Additionally, the study explores the integration of this technology into Chinese culture courses, showcasing its interdisciplinary potential to transform language learning and cultural education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly present in various educational fields and it has already significantly influenced foreign language instruction. AI technologies enable interactive and personalized learning, which can have great benefits, particularly in teaching English for specific purposes. This case study examines how AI tools can be used to design materials and activities suitable for developing medical students’ awareness of register-switching. A generative artificial intelligence chatbot Claude was prompted to produce pedagogically effective materials for teaching register variations. The activities include vocabulary development tasks, reading and writing assignments, listening comprehension exercises, speaking simulations and dialogues. The integration of AI can help teachers adapt teaching to contemporary demands, while students can develop a multi-faceted understanding of medical terminology, improve their communication skills and become more confident in their ability to interact effectively with patients and healthcare professionals. AI-assisted language learning can potentially bridge the gap between classroom instruction and real-world medical communication and better prepare future healthcare professionals for the linguistic challenges in their careers. The paper also discusses ethical considerations related to the development and implementation of AI-assisted activities, focusing on accuracy, transparency, data privacy and responsible use. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the potential of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into Dynamic Assessment (DA) to enhance second language (L2) learning. It aims to shed light on using AI to teach pragmatics, address the scarcity of research in this area, and develop an AI learning platform to meet the need for effective online language tools. To this end, an online AI chatbot platform was developed to function as an instructor, offering Dynamic Assessments (DA). The research, using an Explanatory Mixed Method Design, examined different feedback types—Artificial Intelligence Interventionist Dynamic Assessment (AIIDA), Classroom Interventionist Dynamic Assessment (CIDA), and Direct Feedback (DF)—on immediate and delayed apology and request speech act learning. To accomplish this, 125 undergraduate university students from four intact classroom groups were assigned to the study, which employed a pre-test post-test design with simple random sampling. This number decreased to 87 due to subject mortality and statistical considerations. ANCOVA analysis findings indicate that no significant differences were observed between AI dynamic assessment and classroom dynamic assessment, or between AI dynamic assessment and direct feedback. In contrast, classroom dynamic showed a significant benefit comparing with direct feedback in improving both immediate (sig. = 0.016) and delayed (sig. = 0.041) speech act learning. To elucidate the results, a group interview was conducted to gather participants’ perspectives on the AI platform. The overall findings suggest that AI has the potential to serve as a support for teachers in second language learning by providing around-the-clock personalized feedback, automating tasks, and adaptive learning resources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A comprehensive search across four databases—ProQuest, Google Scholar, Wiley Online Library, and Web of Science—identified 28 empirical studies published between 2020 and 2024 that met predefined inclusion criteria. The review synthesizes current research trends, designs, AI tools, influencing factors, and implementation challenges. Findings reveal that AI-powered tools, including chatbots, speech recognition applications, natural language processing tools, and interactive platforms, positively impact OCS by increasing fluency, reducing anxiety, and boosting learner confidence. These tools facilitate real-time interaction and feedback, fostering active engagement and self-directed learning. However, challenges such as emotional interaction, technical support, contextual adaptation, and data privacy issues remain significant barriers to implementation. This review highlights the potential of AI in transforming EFL education but emphasizes the need for comprehensive teacher training, enhanced AI functionality, improved infrastructure, and hybrid teaching strategies combining AI with traditional methods. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to evaluate AI’s long-term effectiveness and refine its applications to meet diverse learning needs. By addressing these challenges, educators can unlock AI’s full potential, ensuring more inclusive and impactful language learning experiences for EFL students. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Twenty-six freshmen English majors completed recorded oral exams, which were scored both holistically and analytically (with time intervals) by ChatGPT4o and by human raters, including four experienced EFL teachers and 20 students from a parallel class. In addition, both AI and human assessors provided qualitative feedback on accuracy, fluency, and complexity domains of these oral exams. Follow-up interviews with teachers and selected student assessors explored their perceptions of ChatGPT4o as an AI assessor in classroom assessments. The results showed that ChatGPT4o provided more detailed feedback than human assessors across all domains. While the reliability coefficient values for ChatGPT4o’s scoring were slightly lower than those of teachers, they were significantly higher than those of student assessors. Interviews revealed mixed perspectives on adopting ChatGPT4o, with participants recognizing its comprehensive feedback capabilities but expressing concerns about its accessibility, cost, and limited contextual understanding.

	abstract = {This study investigates the application of advanced speech recognition technology to address challenges in university English pronunciation teaching. An automated pronunciation assessment system was developed based on a transformer-driven acoustic model and multidimensional scoring metrics, enabling real-time evaluation of pronunciation accuracy, fluency, and prosody. A controlled experiment involving 120 non-native English learners compared the system with traditional teacher-led assessments. The experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in phonetic accuracy, with a marked reduction in pronunciation errors, and better alignment of speech rhythm compared to the control group. The system also provided consistent, objective feedback and reduced assessment time by over 80\%, making it highly efficient and scalable for large-scale educational environments. Furthermore, this research integrates artificial intelligence into language education, offering innovative tools to support personalized, data-driven, and adaptive learning. The findings highlight the system's potential to enhance the quality of oral English instruction by addressing the inefficiencies and subjectivity of traditional methods. This study contributes to the development of smart education by providing a practical and effective solution for improving students' speaking skills, paving the way for broader applications of AI technologies in language learning and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The current study looks into the key factors behind trepidation or anxiety among English-speaking Iraqi and Yemeni college students. The quantitative approach has been adopted focusing on two factors: fear of communication apprehension and negative evaluation. Twelve items were adapted from the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) and administered to 110 Iraqi and 198 Yemeni students comprising both male and female students. Data analysis revealed that communication anxiety is a shared issue for college students in both Iraq and Yemen with females exhibiting significantly higher anxiety levels than males. The findings underscore that negative evaluation and communication anxiety are critical psychological barriers affecting language performance and participation. Additionally, the study highlights that a lack of sufficient language input and limited opportunities for speaking practice in English classes contribute to heightened anxiety levels. The study proposes the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools into language learning environments as this will provide an innovative, supportive, and non-judgmental environment. In contrast to traditional classroom settings, where students may fear negative evaluation or embarrassment, AI can help reduce anxiety and foster a positive learning atmosphere by simulating real-life communication and providing instant supportive feedback. The study recommends that teachers utilize AI and supportive teaching strategies to create a safe space for language development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Maintaining learning motivation and achieving academic success in English language learning remains a challenge for many university students, particularly those with lower proficiency. Conventional teacher-centered classrooms are often characterized by passive learners with limited personalized support. In contrast, blended and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted learning have emerged as promising alternatives to address motivational and performance challenges in English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts. However, empirical comparisons of these instructional approaches remain limited. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and cognitive constructivism, this study examined the comparative effects of conventional, blended, and AI-blended instructional approaches on Chinese university students’ goal orientation, self-efficacy, instructional support, and English academic achievement. The AI-blended approach integrated tools such as automated writing evaluation (AWE), automated speech recognition (ASR), and the chatbot DouBao to support pre-class learning. A 1.5-year longitudinal within-subject design was employed with 43 first-year EFL students at a Chinese university. Participants experienced all three instructional approaches sequentially, with data collected via motivational questionnaires and achievement tests. Repeated measures analyses, including ANOVA and Friedman tests, were conducted. Results indicated that both blended and AI-blended instruction significantly improved students’ motivation and academic performance relative to conventional instruction. The AI-blended approach produced the most substantial gains in self-efficacy, instructional support, and key language skills such as listening comprehension, translation, and writing. These findings inform ongoing discussions on the integration of AI in EFL pedagogy and provide practical implications for instructional design, teacher preparation, and education policy innovation. The study’s limitations, including the small sample size, limited demographic diversity, and constraints of a within-subject design, should be addressed in future research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Generative artificial-intelligence (GenAI) systems are rapidly permeating language education, yet their effects in multilingual, resource-varied classrooms remain under-examined. This 14-week qualitative multiple-case study investigated how GenAI mediates learner autonomy, inclusive participation, multicultural identity work, and teacher practice in four Indonesian EFL settings (three senior-high schools and one university). Data comprised 24 hours of classroom observation, 76 semi-structured interviews, four focus-group discussions, and 6 752 learner-AI log entries. Reflexive thematic analysis produced four inter-locking themes. AI-mediated autonomy emerged as students progressed from copying teacher prompts to crafting and iterating their own, evidenced by a 142 \% rise in self-initiated prompting and increased lexical diversity (type–token ratio =.58). Inclusive voice was fostered through translanguaging cycles, text-to-speech, and complexity-controlled outputs, elevating the unique-speaker index from.54 to.82. In multicultural identity negotiation, learners embedded local idioms (e.g., sipakatau) and deployed iterative counter-prompts to correct Western-centric bias, averaging 2.1 revisions per cultural task. Pedagogical re-positioning saw teacher talk-time fall from 61 \% to 34 \%, as instructors shifted from grammar transmitters to AI-literacy mentors who facilitated prompt-engineering and bias-hunt workshops. These benefits were conditional on equitable connectivity and critical-AI scaffolding; absent such supports, GenAI risked reinforcing dependency and cultural erasure. The study advances a blended sociocultural–critical-digital-literacy framework, offering practical design principles (prompt workshops, bias-mitigation routines) and policy guidance (minimum-access packages) for the equitable integration of GenAI into language education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the recent explosion of ChatGPT, many higher educational institutions have encouraged second language (L2) educators to weigh the benefits and constraints of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into the curriculum. Such measures may involve detailing ethical implications of using AI on assignments, contributing to instructor hesitancy to implement intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL). Despite the powerful learning potential of chatbots for facilitating pragmatic competence, literature has provided scant practical pedagogical approaches for implementing current AI as chatbots with our students. In this pedagogical piece, we explore illustrative examples of how university language educators can implement AI chatbots (i.e., Lingostar, ChatGPT and Gemini) to promote critical digital literacy and pragmatic competence. We outline previous research on L2 chatbot learning and review the affordances and constraints of several AI chatbots before providing four illustrative lesson plans for university language learners to navigate competences learners struggle to develop: pragmatics and critical digital literacy. We target honorifics in Korean and French (including address forms, honorific verb infixes, and speech styles) as a pragmatic language feature through which speakers index their social positions relative to each other. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the limitations of such tools and the potential for promoting ethical use of AI chatbots for conversational practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In line with rapid advancements in educational technologies and Computer-Assisted Language Learning, it seems that innovative approaches in Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) must also be updated in order to address the growing needs of communication and intelligibility in modern-world multilingual contexts and AI-mediated machine interactions. Furthermore, it appears that the affordances of incorporating musical intelligence into pronunciation training, despite the probable links between the two, remain understudied. The present mixed-methods study was an effort to address this gap by developing a technology-mediated melodic approach to teach the pronunciation of 93 vocabulary items to 39 EFL learners. The technique used Adobe Audition and Ableton Live 10 to create recurrent and incrementally progressive melodies based on word pronunciations for practice purposes in the experimental group and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to measure the accuracy of pronunciations. Results of Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test showed a significant improvement in the experimental group while a between-groups analysis employing Quade test did not locate any significant differences between the two groups. In the qualitative phase, thematic analysis of interviews with 15 learners revealed mostly positive attitudes in users, who found the approach melodic, stimulating, engaging, lasting, and convenient. It is concluded that while CAPT technologies are capable of offering positive outcomes, analogous to the ones obtained by teacher-fronted training, their appeal to learners and other advantages can make them viable candidates for promoting autonomous and ubiquitous L2 pronunciation learning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

After screening 189 studies from seven databases, 22 relevant empirical studies focusing on experiential learning outcomes with AI use were selected, following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The findings highlight AI's transformative impact on school-based EFL education, offering tailored, interactive experiences. Students using AI tools showed significant improvements in reading, writing, listening, speaking, vocabulary, and overall language comprehension compared to traditional methods. Improvements in language proficiency align with all three domains of Bloom's Taxonomy. Tools like Natural Language Processing and Intelligent Tutoring Systems enhance instruction but struggle with language nuances and cultural contexts. Challenges like the digital divide, literacy gaps, teacher readiness and role confusion, cognitive load, and context-specific adaptation persist. Addressing these requires robust infrastructure, teacher training, and institutional support.

A mixed-methods, quasi-experimental design was employed involving 60 intermediate ESL learners divided into a chatbot-assisted experimental group and a control group using traditional practice. Over six weeks, the experimental group engaged in structured interactions with a conversational AI chatbot offering real-time feedback. Pre-and post-tests, engagement surveys, and interviews were used for data collection. Findings revealed that the chatbot group showed significantly higher gains in speaking proficiency and greater improvements in willingness to communicate and self-confidence. Qualitative feedback highlighted increased practice, reduced anxiety, and high learner motivation, though limitations such as repetitive responses and limited cultural understanding were noted. The study concludes that AI chatbots can serve as effective supplemental tools in SLA, especially for enhancing oral skills and learner autonomy. Practical implications suggest integrating chatbots into language curricula for additional speaking practice, particularly in contexts with limited teacher availability. Educators are advised to blend chatbot use with guided instruction and monitor chatbot feedback quality to ensure pedagogical alignment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Despite the proliferation of IT tools, existing research often focuses on individual platforms without providing an analysis of their specific impacts across different learning contexts. This study addresses this gap by evaluating four IT tools – Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, Edmodo, and Tandem – representing gamification, immersive learning, collaborative learning, and real-world conversational practice, respectively. The aim of the research is to assess the effectiveness of these tools in addressing traditional challenges in language education, including limited classroom interaction, lack of personalised instruction, and insufficient exposure to native speakers. The study used quantitative metrics, such as vocabulary acquisition, speaking fluency, and engagement levels, as well as qualitative data from interviews and user feedback. Key findings reveal that each tool excels in specific areas: Duolingo enhances contributes to acquisition through gamification; Rosetta Stone improves listening and pronunciation through immersive methods; Edmodo fosters communicative competence via collaborative tasks; and Tandem develops speaking fluency and intercultural competence through native-speaker interactions. However, limitations were noted, including the lack of cultural depth in Duolingo and limited adaptability in Rosetta Stone. The study concludes that a hybrid approach integrating the strengths of multiple tools offers the most comprehensive solution for language education. The findings point to the importance of accessibility, teacher training, and the thoughtful integration of IT tools into educational frameworks, paving the way for more effective and equitable language learning strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The recent emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded for its transformative potential, yet there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding how this development influences WTC. To address this, our pioneering study investigates the impact of two major AI tools on EFL learners from China, one involving a chatbot and the other an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). 82 first-year undergraduates participated in the study and were assigned to two groups: the AI chatbot group and the ITS group. Pre- and post-session WTC questionnaires, reflection journals and a teacher interview were conducted to collect data. Results revealed significant disparities in WTC changes among the groups. Specifically, the chatbot group displayed significant improvements, while the WTC of the ITS group surprisingly declined. The study delves into the reasons behind these contrasting performances.

	abstract = {Based on the Interaction Hypothesis, the study investigates the impact of different conversational Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) chatbots on English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ willingness to communicate (WTC), foreign language speaking anxiety (FLSA), self-perceived communicative competence (SPCC) and speaking performance. Three groups of Chinese undergraduate students were recruited: a control group (CG, N = 33) and two experimental groups (EG1, N = 33; EG2, N = 33). The CG interacted with the teacher and classmates during the speaking class. In contrast, EG1 interacted with a text- and voice-based conversational GenAI chatbot called Typebot, while EG2 engaged with a conversational GenAI chatbot that featured both text and voice interaction along with human-like avatars named D-ID Agent. Quantitative analysis using multilevel modelling revealed that EG2 showed significant improvements in WTC and SPCC and a notable reduction in FLSA levels compared to CG. However, the pre- and post-speaking test results showed no significant differences in speaking performance across the groups. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews supported these findings, highlighting the immersive learning experience and emotional support provided by the human-like avatars. These results suggest that visually embodied GenAI chatbots can effectively enhance the emotional experience during the language learning. The study provides practical insights for language educators on integrating GenAI technologies in language teaching, emphasising the benefits of human-like avatars in fostering a more engaging and supportive learning environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Research has demonstrated the promising potential of chatbots in education. Moreover, technological advancements, such as ChatGPT, prompted us to reexamine distinctions between pedagogical roles that humans and chatbots assume. In this context, a systematic review of 11 experimental studies on human-chatbot comparisons in language education was performed, yielding 64 statistical findings, which were then categorized into 11 overarching variables. The analysis indicates that chatbots provide benefits comparable to those afforded by human-human interaction in some domains, such as eliciting utterances of similar sophistication, vocabulary, and grammar levels and facilitating improvements in speaking and listening proficiency. In contrast, chatbots were less effective than humans in areas that may demand socially appropriate interpersonal elements, such as sustaining interactivity, providing sufficient information in elaborations, and maintaining a positive attitude toward target language conversations over the long term. Based on the results, we suggest that chatbots be conceptualized as novel interlocutors rather than as simulations striving to perfectly mimic humans and that emphasis be placed on aspects humans should focus more on in educational scenarios where chatbots are involved. Additionally, other implications for researchers and teachers are discussed to inform future research and practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have recently attracted the attention of second language (L2) writing scholars and practitioners. While they recognize the tool's viability, they also raised the potential adverse effects of these tools on accurately reflecting students’ actual level of writing performance. It is, therefore, crucial for teachers to discern AI-generated essays from human-produced work for more accurate assessment. However, limited information is available about how they assess and distinguish between essays produced by AI and human authors. Thus, this study analyzed the scores and comments teachers gave and looked into their strategies for identifying the source of the essays. Findings showed that essays by a native English-speaking (NS) lecturer and ChatGPT were rated highly. Meanwhile, essays by an NS college student, non-native English-speaking (NNS) college student, and NNS lecturer scored lower, which made them distinguishable from an AI-generated text. The study also revealed that teachers could not consistently identify the AI-generated text, particularly those written by an NS professional. These findings were attributed to teachers’ past engagement with AI writing tools, familiarity with common L2 learner errors, and exposure to native and non-native English writing. From these results, implications for L2 writing instruction and future research are discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

There is a dearth of studies that contextualize the use of AI in the English-speaking learning setting, and even fewer studies examined the roles of learners' emotions generated from AI usage in influencing their speaking practice. The current study was designed based on the Expectation Confirmation Model to investigate the impact of perceived enjoyment, willingness to communicate with AI, and innovativeness on influencing EFL learners' continuance learning intention with AI-enhanced tools, such as EAP Talk. Results from the structural equation modelling suggested EFL EAP Talk users perceived positively in AI affordances and wiliness to communicate with AI significantly influenced perceived usefulness and satisfaction, which further impacted their intentions to continue the usage. Moreover, the enjoyment they perceived is significantly associated with continuance intention, while the role of innovation was not suggested. The research model explained 88\% of the variance for continuance behavioral intention.

This study investigated higher education students' views on integrating AI tools to improve English-speaking skills. Existing literature shows growing utilization of AI-enabled technologies like chatbots, voice assistants, and virtual reality to aid English skills development. However, students often encounter challenges and lack access to interactive AI systems that could enhance their language acquisition. A survey gauged students' perceptions of the need to improve English proficiency, potential AI benefits such as personalized practice and pronunciation feedback, implementation barriers, and risks of over-reliance on technology. Results revealed students welcome incorporating AI to supplement instructor-led teaching, but emphasize the continued necessity of human educators, particularly for developing communication skills. Student feedback advocated combining AI's capabilities for self-paced learning with teacher guidance and supervision. The findings provide insights into student attitudes toward AI integration and considerations for leveraging AI's strengths under instructor direction to deliver high-quality English education required for career readiness. This study concludes that a balanced AI approach focused on enriching student-teacher interactions can optimize English-speaking skills for higher education learners. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To analyze pertinent publications in the SSCI journals, a systematic review was conducted for this study, which investigates the trends of chatbots in education studies, with a focus on English speaking skills. Despite the increasing use of AI-powered chatbots in education, limited research has explored how to develop the merits of AI-powered chatbots in English-speaking teaching or learning. The empirical evidence of chatbot applications from 24 research studies conducted in an English-speaking learning environment and published between 2017 and 2023 was examined in this systematic review. The topic of study on chatbots in English language-speaking practice skills was determined to be in its early stages, which suggests that there is a lot of space for performing pertinent research to support creative English-speaking learning and work with chatbots to enhance learning results. The findings suggest that the AI chatbot learning approach for English-speaking proficiency was intended to speed up the English learning process and assist students in meeting the goals or results of the courses. Also, some benefits (e.g. alleviating speaking anxiety and improving speaking pronunciation) were highlighted in each area. Specifically, the study provides insights into the effectiveness of AI chatbots in enhancing students’ English-speaking learning outcomes, confidence, engagement and motivation.

	abstract = {Speaking English skill is crucial and advantageous for Vietnamese undergraduate students. Speaking English accurately and fluently, however, has proven difficult for these students due to limited English speaking environments, resulting in their insufficient language proficiency and unwillingness to speak. While artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are recommended as effective tools in foreign language education for their flexibility, interactivity, and learner-centeredness, enhancing students’ oral communication, little research has considered using an AI voice chatbot to improve students’ English speaking skills in Vietnam. Therefore, there are still gaps for this study to be conducted. An 8-week quasi-experiment was conducted with 30 Vietnamese undergraduate students. The participants were informed of research purposes, implementation, and confidentiality. They practiced English speaking with an AI voice chatbot in two class sessions per week, completed a pre-experiment and post-experiment speaking test, responded to a questionnaire, and participated in a semi-structured interview at the end. The results revealed students’ significant improvement in English speaking skills after using an AI voice chatbot to practice speaking with p {\textless} 0.05. The students also agreed that their English speaking skills improved after the intervention because they could speak English better by using suitable hedging words, grammar structures, and vocabulary. The findings pose positive ways for teachers to integrate the AI voice chatbot into their lesson plans for teaching and learning activities. Some limitations were found related to sample size and technological issues. The study brings about a new English learning environment to the Vietnamese EFL undergraduate. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in countries like China, where English proficiency is increasingly valued for academic, professional, and social advancement. This study tackles the applicability of CALL in productive EAP classrooms in China through surveying the effect of both teacher training and students in an academic speaking component in a master's level English class and intends to examine the component's effectiveness, challenges, and future prospects. Findings show that students benefited from computer-assisted learning in EAP but for productive skills like speaking, they needed more teacher engagement and feedback using digital literacy. Results suggest that learning outcomes can be maximized with moderate teacher training in digital literacy. Trained teachers with AI-assisted feedback skills can improve student motivation and learning outcome, and students will require less outbound resources. Addressing challenges such as varying levels of technological familiarity and keeping up with rapid advancements can be managed through additional support sessions and ongoing professional development. By staying updated with the latest tools and trends, teachers can continuously enhance their curriculum, ensuring that students remain engaged with content that is both current and relevant. The future training will focus on helping students tackle technological issues while ensuring that extra workload will be minimized.

	abstract = {This study explores Korean language learners’ acceptance and experience with the Sejong AI tutor chatbot, grounded in the technology acceptance model 2 (TAM2). The results demonstrate a high acceptance of chatbots in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude, and self-efficacy. Additionally, personal innovativeness and usability moderately influence acceptance. However, perceived behavior control and behavioral intention scores are relatively low. Students report advantages associated with chatbot-based learning, including increased flexibility, reduced language anxiety, and a more enjoyable learning experience. Nonetheless, challenges are also identified, such as frustration with misunderstood speech and limitations in nuanced variety and creativity due to script rigidity. Overall, these findings indicate that AI chatbots can be valuable tools that promote confidence and motivation in Korean L2 speaking practice. However, successful implementation requires advancements in core chatbot functionalities such as speech recognition, dialogue management and personalized feedback. This study provides practical implications for L2 teachers, students, and chatbot developers seeking to optimize AI chatbots for effective language learning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), have been used by teachers to enhance English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning. However, few studies have employed AI in the making of video dramas to facilitate EFL learning. In this study, AI was used to recognize the authentic context of a drama and provide students with meaningful lexical resources, including vocabulary and sentence structures, to inspire them in their writing. Video-to-text recognition (VTR) and AI methods were used to develop an AI-enhanced video drama (AI-EVD) application for EFL learning, and its effectiveness for improving EFL writing and speaking was investigated by recruiting 77 university students in three groups: an experimental group (EG), which used the app, and control groups, which used the app without AI features (CG1) or participated in conventional learning (CG2). Learning achievement in the EG was significantly higher than that in CG1 or CG2. An analysis of the correlation between learning behavior and learning achievement showed that VTR-generated vocabulary, generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-generated sentences, and a pronunciation correction mechanism significantly improved the students’ performance. Further analysis with a stepwise multiple regression model revealed that the GPT-generated sentences feature was the learning behavior with the strongest effect on writing and speaking skills. Moreover, the AI-EVD application was perceived as being easy to use, helpful, and engaging according to the results of student questionnaires and interviews. Therefore, the AI-EVD application can motivate EFL students, enable them to produce meaningful video dramas, and improve their writing and speaking skills. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A meta-analysis of 20 studies published between 2015 and 2022 investigated the impact of AI-based language learning tools on language proficiency, motivation, and engagement. The findings suggest that these tools have a positive effect on language learning outcomes, with moderate to large effect sizes (0.58, 0.44, and 0.44, respectively). The meta-analysis included studies that evaluated the impact of AI-based language learning tools on a variety of language learning outcomes, including vocabulary acquisition, grammar knowledge, listening comprehension, speaking fluency, and writing skills. The results of the meta-analysis showed that AI-based language learning tools had a positive effect on all of these outcomes. The findings of this meta-analysis have important implications for language teachers and instructional designers. These findings suggest that AI-based language learning tools can be an effective way to improve language proficiency, motivation, and engagement among students. These tools have the potential to offer personalized and adaptive learning experiences, which can help address individual student needs and preferences. Additionally, they can provide immediate feedback and opportunities for practice, which can enhance students’ learning outcomes. However, it is important to note that the studies included in this meta-analysis varied in quality, with some studies having small sample sizes or limited control groups. Additionally, some studies only focused on specific aspects of language learning, such as vocabulary acquisition or pronunciation, rather than overall language proficiency. Further research is needed to better understand the specific mechanisms by which AI-based language learning tools improve language learning outcomes and to explore potential drawbacks or limitations of these tools. Overall, the findings of this meta-analysis suggest that AI-based language learning tools have the potential to enhance language learning outcomes, particularly in terms of language proficiency, motivation, and engagement. These findings have important implications for language teachers and instructional designers, who may consider incorporating AIbased tools into their language learning curricula to enhance student learning outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

As AI instructors become a viable option in classrooms, how they affect language learners’ learning warrants investigation. Building upon social presence theory regarding interpersonal relationships in an online environment, this study aimed to examine the role of social presence and AI instructors’ credibility in fostering learner engagement. Additionally, it examined the effects of variables within instructors on instructor credibility and learner engagement. In the study, a 2 (human or AI) x 2 (native or non-native English-speaking teacher) between-subjects design was utilized in an online experiment with 120 English learners. Regression and mediation analyses revealed, in AI-led classes, social presence positively influenced learner engagement, with instructor credibility fully mediating this relationship. According to a two-way MANOVA analysis used to examine the effects of humanness and nativeness on credibility and engagement, no evidence was found to support a difference between AI instructors and their human counterparts when observing learners’ perceptions and engagement, regardless of whether the instructors were NESTs or NNESTs. The results show that AI instructors can be a viable alternative in language classes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper presents the results of an investigation into Elsa’s impact on Japanese junior high school teachers of English who integrated it into their classroom. Although no teacher interviewed denied Elsa’s learning benefits, they essentially consider its unrestricted use disruptive during class. Most teachers also stated that Elsa is neither necessary nor sufficient a repetition or correction method, and that aligning students to a single English pronunciation is not an educational goal they pursue. The study concludes that, unless pronunciation is a criterion for grading, and Elsa can support objective student evaluation, however helpful a learning tool, its adequacy in schools is yet to be demonstrated. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The study is the fourth in a row of consecutive papers on the impact of digital technologies on teaching/acquisition of foreign languages previously via multimedia, and presently via artificial intelligence tools. The joint effort of foreign language teachers teams from National Technical University “Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute” and Vasyl Karazin National University, Kharkiv, Ukraine paved the way for introducing communication simulation techniques into the domain of foreign language teaching / acquisiton as far back as the beginning of the covid pandemic in 2021 to be aggravated by the start of Russian war on Ukraine in 2022 which predominantly focused on distant online learning. The present paper hypothesized the wide use of AI platforms, or Large Language Models (LLM) used here alternatively, like ChatGPT, Bard, and the like on a par with the previously described multimedia techniques and blended traditional learning as efficient for the rapid and intensified skill acquisition. The approach proved completely true both in Listening/Speaking and Reading/Writing for students and the Maxims of effective communication introduced by H.P.Grice and adopted for teachers as 7 Cs (Clarity, Conciseness, Concreteness, Correctness, Cohereness, Completeness, and Courtesy). In addition, the benefits of using ChatGPT for training translators/interpreters proved invaluable for making their skills automated due to the abundance of material and new techniques. Some observations on the challenges and threats of LLM usage by students are also highlighted. As before, the two surveys meant for both students and teachers were proposed for completion at the start and the end of an academic semester, compared, and yielded the results described below. Furthermore, a detailed description of the AI tools used for the research was provided to show how blended learning in the modern digital era is being constantly supplemented with newly developed digital tools, specifically for foreign language learning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the development of economic globalization, many foreign languages have become the most common languages in the world and have been increasingly applied. However, there is a shortage of personnel with high foreign language proficiency in various industries. People should strengthen the cultivation of language skills according to market needs. Translation is the core of language ability, and in order to apply foreign languages to practical communication activities, it is necessary to pay attention to the correction and research of foreign language pronunciation. Previously, foreign language translation systems were conducted according to the instructions of teachers, which not only consumed a lot of manpower but also made it difficult to implement. Therefore, it is very important to research and establish an intelligent translation system. This mode can monitor students' foreign language pronunciation and provide correct suggestions. The traditional intelligent recognition mode and settings for foreign language translations are not accurate enough to accurately recognize foreign language translations, correct foreign language pronunciation correctly, and even produce incorrect pronunciation, thereby affecting foreign language learning. Based on the above issues, this article studied an intelligent foreign language translation recognition model based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithm and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) algorithm, in order to automatically recognize foreign language translations. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model, simulation experiments were conducted in the simulated environment in the article. The experimental results showed that compared to existing systems, the machine synchronous translation system of artificial intelligence technology and speech recognition (in this article) had the highest translation recognition accuracy of 95 00\%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a common phenomenon for language learners involving both psychological and physiological symptoms. Timely and effective PSA assessment can help diagnose learners’ speaking anxiety, offer learners feedback to alleviate their anxiety, and improve their public speaking competence. However, it is still a challenging issue to achieve accurate automated assessment of learners’ PSA due to the lack of large-scale and open-source multimodal datasets based on real classroom settings. This study collected the public speaking videos of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners in public speaking courses, and constructed a large-scale multimodal dataset named Speaking Anxiety in Real Classrooms (SARC) with three modalities of acoustic, visual, and textual data (including 1,158 manually-annotated speech videos and corresponding speech drafts of 382 participants). A multimodal deep learning model for automated assessment of learners’ speaking anxiety was proposed, and an online formative assessment platform was then developed to realize the automated assessment of PSA for classroom teaching. A pilot survey study involving 78 participants was then conducted to investigate learners’ acceptance of the platform. Experimental results verified the validity of the deep learning model and the consistency between automated assessment and teacher assessment. Learners’ acceptance data further indicated that collaboration between automated and human assessment provided them with the most satisfactory experience of using the platform to improve their English public speaking. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mobile technologies have become increasingly important in the field of education, providing innovative ways to engage students and enrich their learning experiences. ChatGPT is an innovative tool that can be used in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) classes to engage students, enhance their knowledge and skills, and add variety and interest to the traditional process of learning engineering English, whether accessed through computers or mobile devices. In light of this, the study aims to investigate and compare the attitudes of technical university students and teachers towards using ChatGPT in English classes, as well as their perspectives on academic integrity issues and the strategies they employ when using ChatGPT. The study involved 22 teachers and 60 students from a Ukrainian university. Quantitative research, which involved collecting data through surveys, showed that students exhibited positive attitudes, while teachers took a more neutral approach. Both groups agree that ChatGPT plays a supplementary role in enhancing both hard and soft skills, as well as English language communication skills. However, they emphasized its impact on the development of research skills. The study highlights critical issues related to academic integrity, specifically the differing perceptions of possible violations between students and teachers. The authors present ideas on integrating ChatGPT into ESP classes, enabling teachers to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools for language learning and adapt to changing educational landscapes. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating ChatGPT effectively into engineering English classes to support students’ learning. While emphasizing the importance of guidelines for academic integrity, it also advocates for the creative use of AI tools by teachers and students. Addressing the disparity in attitudes suggests providing teacher professional development to ensure proficient use of AI tools. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The article analyses the implementation and efficacy of artificial intelligence in teaching English to first-year students at the Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University. The present study examined the effects of AI chatbots on students' speaking abilities and overall experiences in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom. The participants were 11 EFL teachers and 51 Abai University students, who were randomly assigned into two groups: an experimental cohort and a control cohort. The experimental group, consisting of over 26 students, received instruction through AI-based educational programs, while the control group, comprising over 25 students, received instruction through traditional teaching methods. Employing a pre-and post-test research design, the present study undertook a comparative analysis of students' progress in English speaking skills, both within and between experimental and control groups. The findings of the conducted tests have indicated that both groups exhibited a significant improvement in their oral communicative abilities, as evidenced by their performance in the two speaking tasks, namely reading a text aloud and answering questions. As for the student's proficiency and fluency, it was observed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of pronunciation. However, a discernible variation was detected in their intonation and stress patterns during the reading task. The results of this questionnaire offer an analysis of students' attitudes and opinions regarding integrating AI chatbots into language learning. This sheds light on the potential benefits and limitations of utilising such technology in the EFL context. Furthermore, the recent study explores the potential of AI chatbots as an effective tool to facilitate language learning and their future applications in the EFL setting. The implications of the research findings are thoroughly discussed, considering how AI chatbots can potentially enhance language learning and their potential usefulness in EFL education in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Public speaking is considered the most anxiety-provoking speaking activity for English as a foreign language (EFL) learner. While traditional lecture-based classrooms hinder EFL learners’ constant practice and frequent interaction due to large class sizes and limited time, recent developments in technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Automatic Speech Analysis, and Virtual Reality (VR), may enhance language learning by offering accessible and personalized learning experiences. This study aimed to investigate the effects of technology-enhanced learning on reducing EFL learners’ PSA. Thirty-three university students were divided into three groups and received either lecture-based, mobile-assisted, or VR-facilitated instruction for four weeks. The students’ perceived PSA levels were reduced in all three groups after their respective instruction, but only the VR-facilitated group reached statistical significance, and there were no differences in the three groups’ final oral performances. However, the two technology-enhanced language learning (TELL) groups achieved more convergent performances on the Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety scale compared with the non-TELL group, which indicated that the impact of individual differences may have been compensated by technology assistance. The findings suggested that the instructional feedback generated by AI decreased the participants’ PSA, although the irreplaceable role of teachers as facilitators was also emphasized, while the potential of using VR in teaching public speaking was evident. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been widely researched in recent years and found to be useful in developing the speaking skills of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. The AI-generated scores and feedback could help learners improve pronunciation, intonation, fluency, vocabulary and grammar. Additionally, AI can create a safe and private environment for learners to practise without fear of ridicule, reducing stress and anxiety while enhancing their communicative confidence. English language learning applications that incorporate AI technology have also been widely proven to be capable of facilitating independent speaking practice for learners. However, there is a dearth of research evaluating AI applications for the individual speaking practice of EFL learners in mainland China. Insufficient evaluations of particular English learning applications designed for Chinese speakers might impede university EFL teachers and researchers from acknowledging the potential benefits of these tools. This chapter delineates the primary features of a novel AI-driven speech assessment platform, EAP Talk, developed by Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU). It illustrates how this program enhances students’ speaking abilities and its potential utility in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and EFL education. Moreover, it introduces the program’s effectiveness and high acceptance through previous experimental studies, alongside identifying future AI-assisted language learning and teaching research avenues. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Despite the increasing use of AI-powered chatbots in language learning, there is a lack of studies exploring the attitudes and perceptions of teachers and students towards these intelligent tutors. This study aims to compare several linguistic and technological aspects of four App-Integrated Chatbots (AICs) and to examine the perceptions among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teacher candidates. In this mixed-methods research based on convenience sampling, 237 college students from Spain (n = 155) and the Czech Republic (n = 82) interacted with four AICs over a month, and evaluated them following a rubric based on the Chatbot-Human Interaction Satisfaction Model. This scale was specifically designed to assess different linguistic and technological features of AICs such as response interval, semantic coherence, sentence length, and user interface. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through a pre-post-survey, based on the CHISM model and student assessment reports. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS statistics software, while qualitative data were examined using QDA Miner software, focusing on identifying recurring themes through frequency analysis. The findings indicated a moderate level of satisfaction with AICs, suggesting that enhancements in areas such as better adapting to learner needs, integrating interactive multimedia, and improving speech technologies are necessary for a more human-like user interaction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study aims to examine the benefits of using ICT and AI technologies to aid the improvement of students' spoken communication skills, as well as the factors that contribute to students' difficulties with speaking. The study's primary goal is to provide useful recommendations for students, teachers, and learners that will facilitate better English language instruction and learning. Different studies were analyzed, and elements related to difficulties with communication were separated into three distinct groups: linguistic, social, and affective. We looked into numerous information and communication technology (ICT), Apps, and artificial intelligence (AI) resources that help in teaching and learning English. 100 students are participated in our experiment, who were placed into two groups: ICT and Non-ICT. Taught English for the Non-ICT group using traditional methods and for the ICT group using ICT and AI tools. When compared to non-ICT students, ICT students demonstrate superior performance in all parameters of the speaking test. ESL students will see significant improvements in their communication skills with the use of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for teaching and learning language. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {English's dominance as the world's most widely spoken language has shown how attractive it is to students looking to advance their education. Due to its dominance in business and education, English has become a prerequisite for many professions. Some primary barriers to speaking English clearly and fluently include a lack of inspiration and desire, the use of traditional learning and teaching techniques, being discouraged by teachers and instructors, and a fear of not learning English quickly. Using board games in English language training has been the focus of study, particularly in improving students' speaking abilities, fluency, and accuracy. This study examines how a 3D mobile learning board game affects high school students' vocabulary retention and fluency. The game was designed to supplement traditional teaching methodologies using game-based learning concepts. The researchers used an iterative approach to design, test, and enhance the board game application. The mobile game application was created using a randomized algorithm. The game's effectiveness in enhancing pupils' English language proficiency was also determined by reviewing survey data. According to the findings, employing the board game had a statistically significant beneficial effect and fit the ISO 9126 Evaluation. These findings imply that including board games in English language learning can augment instructional methodologies, raise student learning motivation, active involvement, and focus, and improve social skills, knowledge, and problem-solving abilities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study aims to discover ten main current research trends of performance in second language from 2012 to 2022. It will search scientific articles in the Social Science Citation Index (WOS) and in the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) databases and discover which are emergently compared to the previous decade. Finally, the study discusses these topic trends, other alternates and transversal-related issues. It presents a critical vision of the state-of-the-art of the last 20 years, considering reference publications. The method is a documentary review that selects ten scientific articles from the last decade to discover deep trends. This documentary methodology differs from a systematic bibliographic review in that it allows selecting and delving deeper into the qualitative content of the articles. Thanks to the quality system implemented, the articles published in these journals included in thе WOS database ensure significant studies that ensure scientific contributions and discoveries in the field. The main results are ten recurring topic trends with the previous decade on language learning programs, evaluation, teaching strategies, communication and psychological approach, digital devices, teacher action, cognitive approach, speaking performance, motivation and instructional performance language. The major conclusions highlight emerging interdisciplinary approaches to different variables and the adaptive study of emerging technologies, such as AI, without great interest in linguistic or economic policy issues. However, searches on other academic platforms find a broader open debate for two decades with other contextual parameters about economic factors and language policy, such as the literacy of immigrants in L2 as a factor of social and economic interest, the formal programming of a second language in institutions to obtain employment, especially in the professional framework of international mobility. This means that the WOS database collects general trends in this investigated topic. However, it only partially collects the breadth of scientific interest generated as a result of the needs of the socio-economic context. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {English grammar multiple-choice questions (MCQs) can be automatically generated to reduce preparation time. Previous studies have focused on semiautomated methods based on the transformation of human-made sentences/articles into MCQs, owing to which the number of generated questions is dependent on the size of a given text corpus. This study proposes an artificial intelligence-assisted MCQ generation system that increases the number of generable questions using controllable text generation techniques. In this system, the questions for MCQs are generated using a text generation model trained using the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture, a powerful deep learning model for performing text generation tasks, with a keyword and a part-of-speech (POS) template as the input for content and grammar topic control. For the text-to-MCQ transformation process, answer-to-MCQ and distractor-selection strategies are proposed for 10 grammar topics using rule-based algorithms. The quality of the generated MCQs is evaluated by human experts. The acceptance rate of the questions generated using the proposed system is 86\%. The controllability of content and grammar topics are 96.86\% and 98.57\%, respectively. The findings of this study show that the T5 model achieves good performance in terms of controlling the POS structure in a keyword-to-text generation task. Moreover, the good acceptance rate indicates that artificial intelligence has the potential to help teachers speed up the process of selecting examination questions. We also discuss extending the proposed system to other grammar topics and the limitations of the proposed system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, hardly anyone working in the field of foreign language teaching and learning can imagine life without machine translation (MT) tools. Thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence, MT now most widely assumes a new form, the so-called Neural Machine Translation (NMT), which offers the potential for a wide application in foreign language learning (FLL). Therefore, the purpose of this review study is to explore different approaches to the efficient implementation of NMT into FLL and provide specific pedagogical implications for best practices. The PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews and meta-analyses was strictly followed. The search was conducted in two well-established databases, specifically Scopus and Web of Science, to generate sufficient data from research articles for further analysis. The findings of this systematic review indicate that NMT is an efficient tool for developing both productive (speaking and writing) and receptive (reading and listening) language skills, including mediation skills, which are relevant for translation. Moreover, the results show that NMT tools are especially suitable for advanced learners of L2, whose higher proficiency level enables them to critically reflect on the output of NMT texts more than beginners or lower-intermediate learners. Thus, the findings of this review study reveal that NMT has valuable implications for L2 pedagogy since it can serve as a very powerful online reference tool for FLL provided that teachers introduce students to its benefits but also limitations by implementing various teaching approaches. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Each learner completed a learner engagement survey within 72 hours of the online class. Results demonstrated that young learners were highly engaged during this one-to-one online learning setting (mean = 4.5, out of 5). Learners’ frontal face exposure (indicating their attentiveness during class) and English proficiency levels are significant and positive predictors of learner engagement. Teachers’ total length of speech and instructional time tended toward significance in predicting learner engagement.

The primary purpose of this study is to investigate learners’ perceptions towards ASR technology after it is applied to traditional classrooms. This study selected 249 English majors from a university in Northeastern China as samples and divided them into a control group consisting of 124 students and an experimental group including 125 students. The participants of two groups used ASR technology in the process of oral practice, and the experimental group also added teacher’s guidance compared with the control group. The teacher gives more detailed instruction in speaking based on the scores provided by ASR technology. Participants needed to complete relevant questionnaires and learning reflective journals during the experiment. The results of the study showed that both participants and instructors held positive and satisfactory attitudes towards the potential of ASR in oral training and believed that the technology could meet many of their needs such as the scoring system to help them more intuitively understand the real speaking level.

	abstract = {The unique affordances of mobile devices enable the design of novel language learning experiences with auto-generated learning materials. Thus, they can support independent learning without increasing the burden on teachers. In this paper, we investigate the potential and the design requirements of such learning experiences for children. We implement a novel mobile app that auto-generates context-based multimedia material for learning English. It automatically labels photos children take with the app and uses them as a trigger for generating content using machine translation, image retrieval, and text-to-speech. An exploratory study with 25 children showed that children were ready to engage to an equal extent with this app and a non-personal version using random instead of personal photos. Overall, the children appreciated the independence gained compared to learning at school but missed the teachers' support. From a technological perspective, we found that auto-generation works in many cases. However, handling erroneous input, such as blurry images and spelling mistakes, is crucial for children as a target group. We conclude with design recommendations for future projects, including scaffolds for the photo-taking process and information redundancy for identifying inaccurate auto-generation results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Fourth Industrial Revolution which features rapid expansion of technology and digital application is influencing almost all spheres of our lives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made an impact on the way we live and work, that is, from floor cleaning to instructing Alexa. AI has a great potential in the field of education. AI in education is an emerging field in educational technology. It has an enormous potential of providing digitalized and completely personalized learning to each learner. However, the idea of using AI in education is actually intimidating educators because there is a lot of misconception and misunderstanding regarding the use of AI in education. It is mainly because the educators are unaware of the pedagogical implication of it in education in general and language learning in particular. It is also because of the lack of critical reviews of the pedagogical implications and new approaches in adopting AI in education. Therefore, the present study attempts to explore how AI can be used to enhance language learning experiences. It discusses the tools that can be used to teach English effectively. It further aims to explain how AI can be used to foster learner's autonomy. It essentially envisions AI embedded learning in classrooms to enhance English language teaching learning experience and assist the teachers teach their lessons effectively. The findings bring into light some practical and innovative ways, AI can be integrated in ELT classroom to enhance the language teaching learning experience. It focuses on teaching pronunciation and increasing fluency by mimicking the sound pattern and using speech recognition and speech editing features. Moreover, it also highlights the personal approach to language learning by using Chatbot which provides text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion, using technology to transcribe speech in order to check the pronunciation, translate speech, and practicing conversation by using voice command like Google Assistant. Hence, the paper examines the potential application of AI in education and language learning in particular. Further, it explores the possibilities of implication of AI in classrooms adopting new learning approaches and pedagogical modifications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Today, English is the world's main international language and is widely spoken. In this context, the learning of English has long been valued by all countries. In addition, English plays an essential role in the process of economic globalization, specifically in the majority of countries where English is not the native language. At the same time, as China's integration into the world grows, the importance of English has become more pronounced, and the demand for English language skills has increased. At present, China's ever-expanding opening to the outside world, its developing science and technology, and its rising international status have created an urgent need for English-speaking professionals. This will lay the foundation for China's economic and social development and enable China to play a greater and more active role in international affairs, which has great practical and far-reaching historical significance. At present, the traditional English teaching mode has been criticized due to a great number of issues. At the same time, the new English language standards and the change of evaluation methods have created new demands on English teaching methods. As a result, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education has brought new directions for the optimization of English classroom. In addition, diversified network technologies also provide new support for the realization of intelligent and collaborative English classroom teaching. To be specific, the maturity of English intelligent speech synthesis and intelligent speech evaluation technologies has enabled intelligent technologies to reach or even surpass the level of human teachers in certain areas. However, due to the limitations of the market environment and evaluation methods, the products that can focus on English classroom teaching are not highly intelligent and less collaborative. What is more, the process of English classroom intelligence has stagnated compared to other subjects. Obviously, from the perspective of integrating artificial intelligence technology with English classroom, it is quite necessary and feasible to design and develop an intelligent teaching assistant that can be applied to college English teaching. As information technology continues to evolve, both national and teacher levels are beginning to focus on how it can be better used in the teaching of subjects. Therefore, the use of online information technology in teaching and learning presents a great opportunity for research and practice in English language learning at the university level. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Indeed, the possibilities of adaptive learning are growing and can now vary according to the implemented digital tools and (most importantly) the needs of teachers and the often-heterogeneous profiles of students. This article presents the interactive platform GamesHUB, designed to promote Universal Design Learning (UDL) in Swiss French-speaking classrooms. GamesHUB is a full Web platform that allows the customization of teaching pathways depending on didactic goals and the needs of teachers and students. As part of the European “PEAPL” project, GamesHUB aims to assist teachers in pathways customization through an automation of this process, in partnership with the LIRIS computer science laboratory (France). This automation will be relying on a suggestion system based on the calculation of competency profiles from the learning tracks analytics. The article will describe the current functioning of GamesHUB, namely the adaptable pathways. In a second step, we introduce the principle of automation while mentioning the problem of trust and the need for transparency when it comes to artificial intelligence. Therefore, we present the learner and domain modeling underlying to the profile of competences. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {English is the most used second language in the world. Mastering vocabulary is the prerequisite for learning English well. In middle school, students direct their own studying outside the classroom to facilitate memorizing and understanding. However, the lack of teacher guidance in the self-study process will negatively affect learning. Producing video lecture materials including talking teachers costs time, energy, and money. The development of artificial intelligence makes it possible to create such materials automatically. However, it is still unclear whether a system embedded with AI-generated virtual teachers can facilitate self-study compared with the system with merely the speech in self-study in K12. To address this gap, we conducted a user study with 56 high school students, collecting learning outcomes, user experience, and learning experience. Results showed that the virtual teacher helps to improve the student’s English learning performance both in retention and transfer. Participants reported high user and learning experience. Our findings shed light on the use of virtual teachers for self-study students in K12. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article reviews a mobile application called ELSA Speak, also known as ELSA, which has exclusively been designed for pronunciation development in EFL/ESL. Pronunciation is an important skill whose teaching is often neglected in second language teaching due to a number of reasons, including teachers' lack of confidence or training in teaching the skill, perceived lack of importance of pronunciation teaching and lack of sufficient and easy-to-use materials. Therefore, an application like ELSA can be beneficial and serve as a supplementary teaching aid for teachers. Furthermore, it can provide language learners with opportunity to enhance their pronunciation on their own and become more autonomous in learning the skill. It is worth noting that the feature that distinguishes ELSA from other pronunciation-development apps is its built-in speech recognition technology, which has made it rank among the world’s top five artificial intelligence apps. However, ELSA is not flawless and can be improved in several respects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The machines are directly or indirectly used in different sectors like healthcare, automatic vehicles, and complex decision-making and at the same used in educational institutes. The usage of AI-based systems and the Internet has brought numerous educational innovations for both teachers and students. With the online learning platforms grounded on AI techniques, 5G has revolutionized the teaching and learning methods by smooth and faster access to educational content. Students of foreign languages, especially English learners, can now use chatbots and intelligent tutoring systems to learn and practice their speaking and listening skills offline and online. With Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), the English learning process can now be interactive and productive. The students can now improve their language skills by conversing with AI-based agents instead of native speakers to avoid any fear and anxiety. The intelligent platforms can understand the consuming power of the student and hence can create and give content according to their level to create an individualized learning environment. With the help of digital assistants, people can also find it very easy and productive to improve English proficiency. To accomplish the goal of English teaching very easily and ideally, the teachers should use AI-based techniques in the classrooms. With the help of intelligent assistants for the daily workload of a teacher, we will be able to concentrate fully on the language learning and skills of the students.

This study analyzes the application of image target recognition in English learning task. Task-based approach emphasizes the process of English learning, not the result, the purposeful communication and meaning expression, encourages learners to open their mouths, and emphasizes that English language learning activities and their tasks are realistic in life. In addition, this paper introduces the DNN adaptive technique based on KL divergence regularization to adapt the acoustic model. Finally, this paper uses the experimental contrast method to compare and analyze the algorithm of this research with the traditional algorithm. The research shows that the recognition ability of the algorithm for confusing phonemes is improved than that of traditional algorithms, and this conclusion provides a powerful result for the introduction of error correction algorithms into education networks.

	abstract = {Learning second language using shadowing technique is effective, but also tends to be boring, less motivating, and has no feedback from teacher on whether the pronounciation is already correct or not. On the other hand, there are various gamification elements that can be applied such as progression, rewards, leaderboard, etc., which can provide a learning environment that continues to motivate student to achieve better result. One of the essential element is direct-feedback to determine whether the answers given by the students are already correct or not, by calculating similarity between student's speech and reference speech using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). In this study, a gamified Japanese language learning application based on mobile platform named 'Shadowingu' is developed. The evaluation results showed that gamification is preferred and have significant Effect Size on student's motivation, when compared to the conventional shadowing method, as well as have positive effects on overall learning experience. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many technologies had surfaced to help people understand and learn a language. Learning major languages like English, Spanish, etc., was easier because a lot of people were speaking it and actually knew the structural integrity of its grammar, but what about the minor ones? How would you learn a language easily if you did not know its grammatical structure, especially if the language was not that known? The researchers would present a grammatical tool using deep parsing for Cebuano, a language that was mainly spoken in Central Visayas in the Philippines and was considered as one of the main languages in the whole Visayan region. This grammar tool would be useful mainly to people who wanted to learn the language; students, teachers, people from other regions of the country, and even foreigners. In this study, the researchers would relay the grammar through deep parsing, a method used to give a complete syntactic structure for a group of words. It also showed that the tool, with reliability marks higher than the expected 55\%, would actually help the ones who needed it the most, and look forward for them into using it more. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, it’s expected that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will bring crisis to English education. This means we don’t need any English teachers in the classroom, nor do we need any English education, if we have a machine for English instruction. In Korea, English education has been trying to change from education styles based on cramming and memorization to ones based on communication. However, those people who blamed the cramming and memorizing learning methods for a limited ability to communicate in English are going to embrace the machine itself with the fourth revolution. The purpose of communication is to convey a message. However, it can be delivered very differently depending on speakers’ emotions and feelings which machines do not possess. Therefore, the Fourth Revolution does not have to replace English education. Instead, it should work in cooperation with English education. The purpose of this study is to develop an English class model that uses Artificial Intelligence through Flipped Learning. To do this, English class modules were introduced in blended classes with Flipped Learning class procedures. The model of Cubillos and Ilvento 12 was used to measure self-efficacy, along with a checklist asking about academic self-efficacy, learning motivation, and class satisfaction. Each item consisted of five Likert scales. Questions were answered using the Likert expression 5 point scale, 1 point for ‘not at all’, 2 points for ‘not’, 3 points for ‘normal’, 4 points for ‘yes’ and 5 points for ‘very’, respectively. To find out students’ language achievement, a paired t test was used. The reliability of the test used in the study was tested through Cronbach’s α. The reliability of the items was analyzed over.70. As a result of the study, it was found that an English class model using Artificial Intelligence through Flipped Learning has a positive impact on students’ self-efficacy. There was a statistically significant difference (p{\textless}.05) between the experimental group and the control group in their speaking ability according to teaching methods. Also, in case of academic achievement, there was a significant difference between the two groups in listening and speaking achievement according to teaching methods. In terms of academic self-efficacy, task difficulty (M = 2.95) did not reach the average (M=3.18). For motivation, external motivation was higher (M = 3.89) than intrinsic motivation (M = 3.20), and in case of class satisfaction, evaluation and feedback (M = 3.26) stayed in the lowest range. Evaluation and feedback are somewhat new to the students. This study may be worthwhile in that it gives educators an opportunity to think about the student-centered class and merits in presenting an effective English learning model as a new learning strategy. However, this research has its limitations in that there is some difficulty in generalizing the results because in the present study, the academic self-efficacy and learning motivation on academic achievement was statistically significant, but the influence was very different from the theoretical background of the previous studies. Also the small size of the subjects may also have influenced the result of this study, so subsequent studies will require more comprehensive research including these factors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The objective of this research is to strengthen the idea that a learner centered classroom is an ideal environment for teaching oral skills and to promote communicative approach of teaching. True learning can only be achieved when the learner is made an equal partner in the learning process instead of a Muppet. This research follows an experimental design. The population of the study were preparatory year students of Jazan University. This research was delimited to ELC prep year students studying at AI Ardah College of Translational study. A random sample of 100 preparatory year students were taken from Al-Ardah college with 50 students in the experimental group were students who were free to practice learners autonomy (learner centered approach) and another 50 formed the controlled group. Results were generated with the help of pre tests and post tests and plotted in the form of graphs. The purpose of this research is to show that the traditional teacher centered approach can no longer encompass the needs of the modem classroom. The educational process needs to be an active blend of modeling, coaching. scaffolding and fading. This research is implacable to ESL learners and teachers alike. It also makes recommendations for future study. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a complex condition linked to diabetes, characterized by cardiac and vascular dysfunction, frequently concomitant with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The extracellular matrix glycoprotein Tenascin-C (TNC) has been found to be upregulated under diabetic conditions. However, the potential contributory role of TNC in the progression of DCM remains largely unclear. This study was designed to elucidate the role of TNC in the pathogenesis of DCM. Methods: Diabetes was induced in adult male wild-type (WT) and TNC knockout (TNC-KO) mice, through the administration of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) for five consecutive days. At 18 weeks cardiac and aortic vascular function was evaluated using echocardiography and wire myography. Myocardium and plasma samples were collected for biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses. Cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were used to investigate the impact of diabetes on TNC expression, inflammation, myocardial stiffness and function. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis of cardiac tissue by RNA-sequencing was conducted. Plasma TNC levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cohorts of heart failure patients and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results: TNC-KO diabetic mice showed preserved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis and mitigated endothelial dysfunction compared to WT diabetic animals. Compared with cardiomyocytes of diabetic WT animals, cardiomyocytes of TNC-KO mice developed less stiffness (Fpassive). Additionally, exposing mouse cardiomyocytes and human cardiac fibroblasts to high glucose stress (30 mM) led to a significant increase in TNC expression. Conversely, recombinant human TNC promoted pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in cardiomyocytes. The role of TNC in fibrosis and DCM was found to involve pathways related to p53 signaling and Serpin1k, Ccn1, Cpt1a, and Slc27a1, as identified by RNA sequencing analysis. Additionally, plasma TNC levels were significantly elevated in patients with heart failure, irrespective of diabetes status, compared to healthy individuals. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that in diabetes, TNC contributes to cardiac contractile dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic disturbances in diabetic mouse heart. These results implicate the potential of TNC inhibition as a novel therapeutic approach for treating DCM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This primary health care center-based trial in Mozambique and Tanzania investigates the effect of Truenat platform/MTB assays (intervention arm) combined with rapid communication of results compared to standard of care on TB diagnosis and treatment initiation for microbiologically confirmed TB at 7 days from enrolment. Methods: The Tuberculosis Close the Gap, Increase Access, and Provide Adequate Therapy (TB-CAPT) CORE trial employs a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled design to evaluate the impact of a streamlined strategy for delivery of Truenat platform/MTB assays testing at primary health centers. Twenty-nine centers equipped with TB microscopy units were selected to participate in the trial. Among them, fifteen health centers were randomized to the intervention arm (which involves onsite molecular testing using Truenat platform/MTB assays, process process optimization to enable same-day TB diagnosis and treatment initiation, and feedback on Molbio platform performance) or the control arm (which follows routine care, including on-site sputum smear microscopy and the referral of sputum samples to off-site Xpert testing sites). The primary outcome of the study is the absolute number and proportion of participants with TB microbiological confirmation starting TB treatment within 7 days of their first visit. Secondary outcomes include time to bacteriological confirmation, health outcomes up to 60 days from first visit, as well as user preferences, direct cost, and productivity analyses. Ethics and dissemination: TB-CAPT CORE trial has been approved by regulatory and ethical committees in Mozambique and Tanzania, as well as by each partner organization. Consent is informed and voluntary, and confidentiality of participants is maintained throughout. Study findings will be presented at scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed international journals.

	abstract = {Introduction: Renal fibrosis (RF), being the most important pathological change in the progression of CKD, is currently assessed by the evaluation of a biopsy. This present study aimed to apply a novel functional MRI (fMRI) protocol named amide proton transfer (APT) weighting to evaluate RF noninvasively. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were initially subjected to bilateral kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), unilateral ureteral obstruction, and sham operation, respectively. All rats underwent APT mapping on the 7th and 14th days after operation. Besides, 26 patients underwent renal biopsy at the Nephrology Department of Shanghai Tongji Hospital between July 2022 and May 2023. Patients underwent APT and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mappings within 1 week before biopsy. MRI results of both patients and rats were calculated by comparing with gold standard histology for fibrosis assessment. Results: In animal models, the cortical APT (cAPT) and medullary APT (mAPT) values were positively correlated with the degree of RF. Compared to the sham group, IRI group showed significantly increased cAPT and mAPT values on the 7th and 14th days after surgery, but no group differences were found in ADC values. Similar results were found in human patients. Cortical/medullary APT values were significantly increased in patients with moderate-to-severe fibrosis than in patients with mild fibrosis. ROC curve analysis indicated that APT value displayed a better diagnostic value for RF. Furthermore, combination of cADC and cAPT improved fibrosis detection by imaging variables alone (p {\textless} 0.1). Conclusion: APT values had better diagnostic capability at early stage of RF compared to ADC values, and the addition of APT imaging to conventional ADC will significantly improve the diagnostic performance for predicting kidney fibrosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This systematic review maps the trends of computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) research based on the pedagogy of second language (L2) pronunciation instruction and assessment. The review was limited to empirical studies investigating the effects of CAPT on healthy L2 learners' pronunciation. Thirty peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1999 and 2022 were selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were collected about the studies' contexts, participants, experimental designs, CAPT systems, pronunciation training scopes and approaches, pronunciation assessment practices, and learning measures. Using a pedagogically informed codebook, the pronunciation training and assessment practices were classified and evaluated based on established L2 pronunciation teaching guidelines. The findings indicated that most of the studies focused on the pronunciation training of adult English learners with an emphasis on the production of segmental features (i.e. vowels and consonants) rather than suprasegmental features (i.e. stress, intonation, and rhythm). Despite the innovation promised by CAPT technology, pronunciation practice in the studies reviewed was characterized by the predominant use of drilling through listen-and-repeat and read-aloud activities. As for assessment, most CAPT studies relied on human listeners to measure the accurate production of discrete pronunciation features (i.e. segmental and suprasegmental accuracy). Meanwhile, few studies employed global pronunciation learning measures such as intelligibility and comprehensibility. Recommendations for future research are provided based on the discussion of these results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that affects {\textgreater}10\% of the adult population worldwide. Noninvasive assessment of renal function has important clinical significance for disease diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Objective: To explore the value of mDIXON-Quant combined with amide proton transfer weighted (APTw) imaging for accessing renal function in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Materials and methods: Twenty-two healthy volunteers (HVs) and 30 CKD patients were included in this study, and the CKD patients were divided into the mild CKD (mCKD) group (14 cases) and moderate-to-severe CKD (msCKD) group (16 cases) according to glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The cortex APT (cAPT), medulla APT (mAPT), cortex R2⁎ (cR2⁎), medulla R2⁎ (mR2⁎), cortex FF (cFF) and medulla FF (mFF) values of the right renal were independently measured by two radiologists. Intra-group correlation coefficient (ICC) test was used to test the inter-observer consistency. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the difference among three groups. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the differences of R2⁎, FF and APT values among the patient and HV groups. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to analyze the diagnostic efficiency. The corresponding threshold, sensitivity, and specificity were obtained according to the maximum approximate index. The combined diagnostic efficacy of R2⁎, FF, and APT values was analyzed by binary Logistic regression, and the AUC of combined diagnosis was compared with the AUC of the single parameter by the Delong test. Results: The cAPT value of the HV, mCKD and msCKD groups increased gradually. The mAPT value and cR2⁎ values of the mCKD and msCKD groups were higher than those of the HV group, while the mFF value of the mCKD group was lower than HV group (all P {\textless} 0.05). The cAPT and mAPT values showed good diagnostic efficacy in evaluating different degrees of renal damage, while cR2⁎ and mFF values showed moderate diagnostic efficacy. When combining the APT, R2⁎, and FF values, the diagnostic efficiency was significantly improved. Conclusion: mDIXON-Quant combined APTw imaging can be used for improved diagnosis of CKD. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Omega-3 fatty acids promote fertility in males and females and constitute an important factor in the normal development of the fetus. Objectives: We investigated the effect of omega-3 supplements during ovulation induction treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-related infertility. Methods: A randomized, double-blind study was conducted for 60 treatment cycles in 34 women with PCOS-related oligo/anovulation referred to the fertility clinic at the Bikur Cholim/Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, who underwent ovulation induction with domiphene citrate (50 mg). Sevenn teen women (mean age 33.9 ± 0.9 years) received omega-3 supplements (3 x 600 mg/day) and 17 received placebo capt sules (mean age 32.7 ± 0.9 years) for a maximum of two cycles. We recorded their characteristics and data from their serial hormonal blood tests and ultrasound examinations. We also conducted both univariate and multivariate analyses. The primary endpoint was conception. Results: There were clinical pregnancies in 8/30 (26.7\%) treatment cycles for women receiving omega-3 supplements versus 4/30 (13.3\%) cycles with placebo. Among overweight/obese women (body mass index [BMI] 25-35), there were clinical pregnancies in 8/27 cycles (29.6\%) versus 1/19 (5.3\%) with placebo (P {\textless} 0.04). For overweight/obese PCOS women, omega-3, lower BMI rates, and higher values of the endometrium's thickness increased the odds of becoming pregnant. No harmful side effects from the omega-3 treatment were reported. Conclusions: Omega-3 supplements demonstrated beneficial effects for fertility in women diagnosed with PCOS. Among the overweight/obese participants, the increased clinical pregnancy rate was significant. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: In laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) for patients who receive antiplatelet therapy (APT), it remains unclear whether APT should be continued or temporarily withdrawn. We investigated the safety of perioperative aspirin continuation, specifically focused on bleeding complications. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis utilizing propensity score-matching (PSM). In total, 789 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria, and were divided into two groups. Patients in the continued aspirin monotherapy (cAPT) group continued treatment perioperatively with not more than 2 days of withdrawal (n = 140). Patients with more than 3 days withdrawal of aspirin or who did not receive APT at all were assigned to the non-cAPT group (n = 649). After 1:1 PSM, 105 patients were extracted from each group. Perioperative APT management was determined based on our institutional committee-approved guidelines for antithrombotic management. Results: In PSM cohorts, all patient demographics were comparable between the groups. Regarding intraoperative outcomes, we found no significant difference in operation duration (p = 0.969), blood loss (p = 0.068), and blood transfusion (p = 0.517). Postoperative overall morbidity was 20.0\% and 13.3\% in the cAPT and non-cAPT groups, respectively (p = 0.195). The incidence of bleeding complications was also comparable between the groups (2.9\% vs. 1.0\%, p = 0.317). Assessing the 14 cases with bleeding complications overall in the full cohort, all 7 cases in the non-cAPT group had anastomotic bleeding, which was generally observed shortly after surgery [median postoperative day (POD) 1]. All 7 cases in the cAPT group received additional antithrombotics other than aspirin; bleeding occurred at various sites relatively later (median POD 7), mostly after reinstitution of additional antithrombotic agents. Conclusions: For patients receiving APT, perioperative continuation of aspirin monotherapy could be safe in laparoscopic CRC surgery; however, careful consideration is required at reinstitution of additional antithrombotics where multiple antithrombotic agents are used. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, empirical evidence supporting the pedagogical effectiveness of these systems remains scarce. In this article, a minimal-pair-based CAPT tool that implements exposure-perception-production cycles and provides automatic feedback to learners is tested for effectiveness in training adult native Spanish users (English level B1-B2) in the production of a set of difficult English sounds. Working under controlled conditions, a group of users took a pronunciation test before and after using the tool. Test results were considered against those of an in-classroom group who followed similar training within the traditional classroom setting. Results show a significant pronunciation improvement among the learners who used the CAPT tool, as well as a correlation between human rater's assessment of posttests and automatic CAPT assessment of users. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A front-end feature transformation module is positioned prior to an acoustic model trained on adult speech (1) to leverage on the readily available linguistic resources on adult speech or existing models, and (2) to reduce the acoustic mismatch between child and adult speech. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently outperforms established baselines trained on adult speech across a variety of tasks ranging from speech recognition to pronunciation assessment and fluency score prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Currently, most computer assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems focus on overall scoring or mispronunciation detection. In this paper, we address the issue of refined pronunciation assessment (RPA), which aims at providing more refined information to L2 learners. To meet the major challenge of the lack of densely labeled data, we present the XDF-REPA dataset, which is freely available to the public. The dataset contains 19,213 English word utterances by 18 Chinese adults, among which 4,200 audio clips from 9 speakers are densely labeled by 3 linguists with intended phoneme, actually uttered phoneme, phoneme score for each phoneme, and an overall score for the word as well. To reduce the difference between annotators, scoring rules combining subjectivity and objectivity are defined. To demonstrate the usage of the dataset and provide a baseline for other researchers, a prototype system for RPA is developed and described in the paper, which adopts a DNN-HMM based acoustic model and a variant of Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) to yield all the corrective feedbacks needed for RPA. Experimental results show error detection accuracy varies from 80.1\% to 85.1\% for different subsets and linguists, and accuracy of actually-uttered-phoneme recognition varies from 70.9\% to 80.8\% for different subsets and linguists. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Computers are used in almost all aspects of language learning and have also created numerous opportunities in this area. This study aims to examine the overall effectiveness of using a computer in pronunciation learning and training. A meta-analysis of studies was conducted, which compared the outcomes of students learning the pronunciation of a foreign language (FL) using a computer with the results from those learning pronunciation based on traditional methods of teaching. This meta-analysis examined how effect sizes varied depending on the learners’ age, learners’ target language proficiency, features of pronunciation, educational level, settings, treatment duration, and assessment tasks. This meta-analysis examined the effect of using a computer on pronunciation learning by reviewing 20 studies involving 1014 participants. The findings of the meta-analysis suggest that computer-assisted training has a positive effect on FL pronunciation (d = 0.68), and is equally effective for both young and adult learners, but more effective for beginner and intermediate learners than advanced learners. The studies also suggest that computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) is more beneficial for university students than for school students. However, caution has to be exercised in interpreting the results. The small number of studies, all of very low quality (most with fewer than 100 participants, conducted within the same institution using intervention-related assessments) means that the evidence of effectiveness can only be indicative and not conclusive. More robust, large-scale studies involving several institutions and using objective standardised tests would be needed for more conclusive results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many types of L2 phonological perception are often difficult to acquire without instruction. These difficulties with perception may also be related to intelligibility in production. Instruction on perception contrasts is more likely to be successful with the use of phonetically variable input made available through computer-assisted pronunciation training. However, few computer-assisted programs have demonstrated flexibility in diagnosing and treating individual learner problems or have made effective use of linguistic resources such as corpora for creating training materials. This study introduces a system for segmental perceptual training that uses a computational approach to perception utilizing corpus-based word frequency lists, high variability phonetic input, and text-to-speech technology to automatically create discrimination and identification perception exercises customized for individual learners. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated in an experiment with pre- and post-test design, involving 32 adult Russian-speaking learners of English as a foreign language. The participants' perceptual gains were found to transfer to novel voices, but not to untrained words. Potential factors underlying the absence of word-level transfer are discussed. The results of the training model provide an example for replication in language teaching and research settings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose - Although the use of antiplatelet therapy (APT) is associated with the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), there are limited data on prestroke APT and outcomes, particularly among patients on combination APT (CAPT). We hypothesized that the previous use of antiplatelet agents is associated with increased mortality in ICH. Methods - We analyzed data of 82 576 patients with ICH who were not on oral anticoagulant therapy from 1574 Get with the Guidelines-Stroke hospitals between October 2012 and March 2016. Patients were categorized as not on APT, on single-APT (SAPT), and CAPT before hospital presentation with ICH. We described baseline characteristics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics and outcomes, overall and stratified by APT use. Results - Before the diagnosis of ICH, 65.8\% patients were not on APT, 29.5\% patients were on SAPT, and 4.8\% patients were on CAPT. There was an overall modest increased in-hospital mortality in the APT group versus no APT group (24\% versus 23\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.05; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.10). Although patients on SAPT and CAPT were older and had higher risk profiles in terms of comorbidities, there was no significant difference in the in-hospital mortality among patients on SAPT versus those not on any APT (23\% versus 23\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95\% confidence interval, 0.97-1.05). However, in-hospital mortality was higher among those on CAPT versus those not on APT (30\% versus 23\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; 95\% confidence interval, 1.39-1.63). Conclusions - Our study suggests that among patients with ICH, previous use of CAPT, but not SAPT, was associated with higher risk for in-hospital mortality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present iCALL, a speech corpus designed to evaluate Mandarin Chinese pronunciation patterns of non-native speakers of European descent, developed at the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) in Singapore. To the best of our knowledge, iCALL is larger than any reported non-native corpora to date in terms of utterance number, duration, and number of speakers: iCALL consists of 90,841 utterances from 305 speakers with a total duration of 142 hours. The speakers are gender-balanced, from a diverse native language background, and represent a realistic sampling of the adult age of Mandarin learners. The read utterances are phonetically balanced and are of varying lengths (words, phrases, and sentences). The spoken utterances are phonetically transcribed and perceptually rated with fluency scores by trained native speakers of Mandarin. In this work, we share our experience in corpus design, data collection, and human annotation and analyze phonetic and tonal error patterns, in particular their relationship with speaker demographics and utterance length. Potential applications of the iCALL corpus include computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT), lexical tone recognition, automatic fluency assessment, accent recognition, and accented Mandarin speech recognition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the training of teacher students, simulated teaching is a key method for enhancing teaching skills. However, traditional evaluations of simulated teaching typically rely on direct teacher involvement and guidance, increasing teachers’ workload and limiting the opportunities for teacher students to practice independently. This paper introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework constructed using various open-source tools (such as FastChat for model inference and Whisper for speech-to-text) combined with a local large language model (LLM) for audio analysis of simulated teaching. We then selected three leading 7B-parameter open-source Chinese LLMs from the ModelScope community to analyze their generalizability and adaptability in simulated teaching voice evaluation tasks. The results show that the internlm2 model more effectively analyzes teacher students’ teaching audio, providing key educational feedback. Finally, we conducted a system analysis of the simulated teaching of 10 participants in a teaching ability competition and invited three experts to score manually, verifying the system’s application potential. This research demonstrates a potential approach to improving educational evaluation methods using advanced language technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder affecting the older adult population worldwide. Among the available cognitive screening methods, neuropsychological scale assessments (NSA) are widely employed in clinical practice to evaluate patients’ cognitive functions, particularly through speech-related tasks. However, manual evaluation of NSA is often labor-intensive and susceptible to subjective bias. While Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology offers the potential to automate this process, it frequently faces notable challenges in handling dialectal variations, unclear pronunciations, and insufficient annotated data. These factors often lead to inaccuracies in transcribed speech and hinder the effective validation of assessment outcomes. To address these challenges, particularly the data bottleneck, we propose a novel dual-use paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). In this study, we designed an innovative agent framework employing LLMs not only for automated NSA scoring, thereby replacing manual assessment, but also for reverse-engineering clinical data by simulating patients with varied cognitive impairments. These synthetically generated NSA texts are then utilized in a closed-loop learning process as a form of “supervised learning” to iteratively refine the system prompts of an NSA evaluation agent. The prompt design explicitly incorporates the dialectal speech and pronunciation ambiguities, aiming to equip the NSA evaluation agent with evaluation and reasoning proficiencies comparable to those of experienced clinicians. The evaluations on a dataset of real-world clinical cases demonstrated a substantial 86\% consistency between the NSA evaluation agent's assessments and those of expert physicians, indicating the potential of LLM-driven approaches for accurate and scalable automated NSA in AD screening and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Innovative and scalable training solutions, such as conversational artificial intelligence agents (CAIAs), are essential to meet the complex demands of pharmacy education and practice. Objectives: To explore and synthesize the key characteristics and outcome measures of CAIAs in pharmacy education and propose an evaluation framework for their use in pharmacy education. Methods: A scoping review identified studies published between 2020 and 2025. An evaluation framework was developed to capture key CAIA characteristics and outcome measures using the World Health Organization's digital health framework. Results: Of 961 studies screened, six met inclusion criteria. Five studies originated from English-speaking countries. CAIAs supported training in communication skills (n = 3), human resource management (n = 2), and HIV care (n = 1). Learner interaction with CAIAs was variable and often poorly described. Common features included scenario-based learning, immediate, real-time, automated feedback, interactive-learning, and modalities. Frequently evaluated outcomes were functionality (n = 5), user experience (n = 4), cost-benefit (n = 3), and user characteristics (n = 3). Educational outcome measures of confidence, knowledge and skills were included in three studies. All studies used text-based interaction; two included audiovisual elements, one combined text and voice, and two relied solely on text. Most (n = 5) involved single-user formats. Three studies were in evaluation stage one (feasibility/usability), two were in stage two (effectiveness) and one in stage three (efficacy). Outcomes demonstrated a low uptake for CAIAs, but indicate increased learner confidence, knowledge and communication skills. Eleven educational features were added to our evaluation framework and three educational outcome categories. Conclusion: This review contributed to the development of a framework to guide the design and evaluation of CAIAs in pharmacy education. CAIAs have been introduced in pharmacy education but remain in the early stages of adoption. Further research is needed to validate their effectiveness and expand their use in pharmacy as well test the use of the framework in other healthcare disciplines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Many works harness the powerful reasoning capabilities of these models to comprehend various modalities, such as text, speech, images, videos, etc. However, the research work on LLms for music inspiration is still in its infancy. To fill the gap in this field and break through the dilemma that LLMs can only understand short videos with limited frames, we propose a large language model with state space for long-term video-to-music generation. To capture long-range dependency and maintaining high performance, while further decrease the computing cost, our overall network includes the Enhanced Video Mamba, which incorporates continuous moving window partitioning and local feature augmentation, and a long-term memory bank that captures and aggregates historical video information to mitigate information loss in long sequences. This framework achieves both subquadratic-time computation and near-linear memory complexity, enabling effective long-term video-to-music generation. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves or surpasses the performance of the current state-of-the-art models.

We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in teacher education, using a case of teaching hate incidents management in schools. To this end, we create a multi-agent LLM-based system that mimics realistic situations of hate, using a combination of retrieval-augmented prompting and persona modelling. It is designed to identify and analyse hate speech patterns, predict potential escalation, and propose effective intervention strategies. By integrating persona modelling with agentic LLMs, we create contextually diverse simulations of hate incidents, mimicking real-life situations. The system allows teachers to analyse and understand the dynamics of hate incidents in a safe and controlled environment, providing valuable insights and practical knowledge to manage such situations confidently in real life. Our pilot evaluation demonstrates teachers’ enhanced understanding of the nature of annotator disagreements and the role of context in hate speech interpretation, leading to the development of more informed and effective strategies for addressing hate in classroom settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {When assisting people in daily tasks, robots need to accurately interpret visual cues and respond effectively in diverse safety-critical situations, such as sharp objects on the floor. In this context, we present M-CoDAL, a multimodal-dialogue system specifically designed for embodied agents to better understand and communicate in safety-critical situations. The system leverages discourse coherence relations to enhance its contextual understanding and communication abilities. To train this system, we introduce a novel clustering-based active learning mechanism that utilizes an external Large Language Model (LLM) to identify informative instances. Our approach is evaluated using a newly created multimodal dataset comprising 1K safety violations extracted from 2K Reddit images. These violations are annotated using a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and verified by human annotators. Results with this dataset demonstrate that our approach improves resolution of safety situations, user sentiment, as well as safety of the conversation. Next, we deploy our dialogue system on a Hello Robot Stretch robot and conduct a within-subject user study with real-world participants. In the study, participants role-play two safety scenarios with different levels of severity with the robot and receive interventions from our model and a baseline system powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The study results corroborate and extend the findings from the automated evaluation, showing that our proposed system is more persuasive in a real-world embodied agent setting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced open-domain dialogue systems, yet their ability to convey empathy remains limited, particularly in emotionally sensitive contexts such as counseling or support services. This raises important questions: Can LLMs engage in emotional interactions with users as naturally and meaningfully as a human conversation? Can they truly understand and respond with empathy, making users feel genuinely heard and supported? To address these challenges, we introduce EmpLLM, a framework designed to enhance LLMs’ empathetic capabilities through a combination of psychologist role-play and inner contemplation. We developed a high-quality dialogue dataset for model training and proposed a new evaluation benchmark, EmpTest, to assess the model’s empathy and emotional intelligence. Experimental results demonstrate that EmpLLM significantly improves the model’s ability to engage in emotionally responsive conversations, offering a promising path toward more human-like and empathetic conversational agents. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Traditional reporting mechanisms require manual data entry, creating accessibility barriers and delaying response times. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ReACT\_OCRS, an AI-driven voice-based cybercrime reporting system that allows victims and witnesses to anonymously submit complaints through audio recordings. Leveraging speech recognition transformers, a recent language model, and encryption, the system processes real-time multilingual voice inputs, extracts meaningful content, and classifies reports with high precision using a hybrid voting mechanism. Experimental evaluations on synthetically generated and human-validated datasets confirm the system’s ability to accurately transcribe, classify, and securely process audio complaints while preserving user anonymity.

A potential solution is to use virtual agents that perform motivational interviews. These agents can be rule-based, requiring expert knowledge, or data-driven, needing large datasets for training, which are often hard to obtain. Patient simulation can generate synthetic data as an alternative. Traditionally, this involved template utterances with a dialog manager or uncontrollable black box large language models LLMs. This study proposes a hybrid approach, leveraging both methods to see if LLMs can follow instructed dialog acts while generating natural, coherent utterances. Our study shows that the language model adheres to given conditions and that conditioning on dialog improves the naturalness and coherence of generated utterances, validating our approach for simulating patient responses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have shown promise for the assessment of formal thought disorder, a hallmark feature of schizophrenia in which disturbances to the structure, organization, or coherence of thought can manifest as disordered or incoherent speech. We investigated the suitability of modern Large Language Models (LLMs - e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama 3) to predict expert-generated ratings for three dimensions of thought disorder (coherence, content, and tangentiality) assigned to speech samples collected from both patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 26) and healthy control participants (n = 25). In addition to (1) evaluating the accuracy of LLM-generated ratings relative to human experts, we also (2) investigated the degree to which the LLMs produced consistent ratings across multiple trials, and we (3) sought to understand the factors that impacted the consistency of LLM-generated output. We found that machine-generated ratings of the level of thought disorder in speech matched favorably those of expert humans, and we identified a tradeoff between accuracy and consistency in LLM ratings. Unlike traditional NLP methods, LLMs were not always consistent in their predictions, but these inconsistencies could be mitigated with careful parameter selection and ensemble methods. We discuss implications for NLP-based assessment of thought disorder and provide recommendations of best practices for integrating these methods in the field of psychiatry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research delves into the exploration of the potential of tocopherol-based nanoemulsion as a therapeutic agent for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) through an in-depth molecular docking analysis. The study focuses on elucidating the molecular interactions between tocopherol and seven key proteins (1O8a, 4YAY, 4DLI, 1HW9, 2YCW, 1BO9 and 1CX2) that play pivotal roles in CVD development. Through rigorous in silico docking investigations, assessment was conducted on the binding affinities, inhibitory potentials and interaction patterns of tocopherol with these target proteins. The findings revealed significant interactions, particularly with 4YAY, displaying a robust binding energy of −6.39 kcal/mol and a promising Ki value of 20.84 μM. Notable interactions were also observed with 1HW9, 4DLI, 2YCW and 1CX2, further indicating tocopherol's potential therapeutic relevance. In contrast, no interaction was observed with 1BO9. Furthermore, an examination of the common residues of 4YAY bound to tocopherol was carried out, highlighting key intermolecular hydrophobic bonds that contribute to the interaction's stability. Tocopherol complies with pharmacokinetics (Lipinski's and Veber's) rules for oral bioavailability and proves safety non-toxic and non-carcinogenic. Thus, deep learning-based protein language models ESM1-b and ProtT5 were leveraged for input encodings to predict interaction sites between the 4YAY protein and tocopherol. Hence, highly accurate predictions of these critical protein–ligand interactions were achieved. This study not only advances the understanding of these interactions but also highlights deep learning's immense potential in molecular biology and drug discovery. It underscores tocopherol's promise as a cardiovascular disease management candidate, shedding light on its molecular interactions and compatibility with biomolecule-like characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients who speak languages other than English face barriers to equitable healthcare delivery. Machine translation systems, including emerging large language models, have the potential to expand access to translation services, but their merits and limitations in clinical practice remain poorly defined. We aimed to assess the performance of Google Translate and ChatGPT for multilingual translation of pediatric discharge instructions. METHODS: Twenty standardized discharge instructions for pediatric conditions were translated into Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, and Haitian Creole by professional translation services, Google Translate and ChatGPT-4.0, and evaluated for adequacy (preserved information), fluency (grammatical correctness), meaning (preserved connotation), and severity (clinical harm), along with assessment of overall preference. Domain-level ratings and preferred translation source were summarized with descriptive statistics and compared with professional translations. RESULTS: Google Translate and ChatGPT demonstrated similar domain-level ratings to professional translations for Spanish and Portuguese. For Haitian Creole, compared with both Google Translate and ChatGPT, professional translations demonstrated significantly greater adequacy, fluency meaning, and severity scores. ChatGPT (33.3\%, P {\textless} .001) and Google Translate (23.3\%, P 5 .024) contained more potentially clinically significant errors (severity score \#3) for Haitian Creole than professional translations (8.3\%). Professional Haitian Creole (48.3\%) and Portuguese (43.3\%), but not Spanish (15\%), translations were most frequently preferred among translation sources. CONCLUSIONS: Machine translation platforms have comparable performance to professional translations for Spanish and Portuguese but shortcomings in quality, accuracy, and preference persist for Haitian Creole. Diverse multilingual training data are needed, along with regulations ensuring safe and equitable applications of machine translation in clinical practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

ChatGPT and Gemini provided NONMEM curriculum structures combining foundational knowledge with advanced concepts (e.g., covariate modeling and Bayesian approaches) and practical skills including NONMEM code structure and syntax. ChatGPT provided an informative summary of the NONMEM control stream structure and outlined the key NONMEM Translator (NM-TRAN) records needed. ChatGPT and Gemini were able to generate code blocks for the NONMEM control stream from the lay language prompts for the two coding tasks. The control streams contained focal structural and syntax errors that required revision before they could be executed without errors and warnings. The code output from ChatGPT and Gemini was not reproducible, and varying the temperature hyperparameter did not reduce the errors and omissions substantively. Large language models may be useful in pharmacometrics for efficiently generating an initial coding template for modeling projects. However, the output can contain errors and omissions that require correction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Virtual patient (VP) simulations have been widely used for healthcare training, education, and assessment.However, fewVP systems have integrated emotion sensing and analyzed how a user's emotions may influence the overall training experience. This article presents a VP that can recognize and respond to 5 human emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness), as well as 2 facial expressions (smiling and eye contact). Methods: The VPwas developed by combining the capabilities of a facial recognition system, a tone analyzer, a cloud-based artificial intelligence chatbot, and interactive 3-dimensional avatars created in a high-fidelity game engine (Unity). The system was tested with healthcare professionals at Changzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. Results: A total of 65 participants (38 females and 27 males) aged between 23 and 57 years (mean = 38.35, SD = 11.48) completed the survey, and 19 participants were interviewed. Most participants perceived that the VP was useful in improving their communication skills, particularly their nonverbal communication skills. They also reported that adding users' affective states as an additional interaction increased engagement of the VP and helped them build connections with the VP. Conclusions: The emotionally responsive VP seemed to be functionally complete and usable. However, some technical limitations need to be addressed before the system's official implementation in real-world clinical practice. Future development will include improving the accuracy of the speech recognition system, using more sophisticated emotion sensing software, and developing a natural user interface. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Depression is prevalent, chronic, and burdensome. Due to limited screening access, depression often remains undiagnosed. Artificial intelligence (AI) models based on spoken responses to interview questions may offer an effective, efficient alternative to other screening methods. Objective: The primary aim was to use a demographically diverse sample to validate an AI model, previously trained on human-administered interviews, on novel bot-administered interviews, and to check for algorithmic biases related to age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Methods: Using the Aiberry app, adults recruited via social media (N = 393) completed a brief bot-administered interview and a depression self-report form. An AI model was used to predict form scores based on interview responses alone. For all meaningful discrepancies between model inference and form score, clinicians performed a masked review to determine which one they preferred. Results: There was strong concurrent validity between the model predictions and raw self-report scores (r = 0.73, MAE = 3.3). 90 \% of AI predictions either agreed with self-report or with clinical expert opinion when AI contradicted self-report. There was no differential model performance across age, sex, race, or ethnicity. Limitations: Limitations include access restrictions (English-speaking ability and access to smartphone or computer with broadband internet) and potential self-selection of participants more favorably predisposed toward AI technology. Conclusion: The Aiberry model made accurate predictions of depression severity based on remotely collected spoken responses to a bot-administered interview. This study shows promising results for the use of AI as a mental health screening tool on par with self-report measures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Taking a medical history is a core competence of the diagnostic process. At the beginning of their study medical students need to learn and practice the necessary techniques, initially focusing on good structuring and completeness. For this purpose, an interactive software system (ViPATalk) was developed in which the student can train to pose questions to virtual patient avatars in free conversation. At the end, the student receives feedback on the completeness of the questioning and an explanation of the essential items. The use of this software was compared to the traditional format of student role play in a randomized trial. Methods: The central component of ViPATalk is a chatbot based on the AI language AIML, which generates an appropriate answer based on keywords in the student's question. To enable a realistic use, the student can enter the question via microphone (speech-to-text) and the answer generated by the chatbot is presented as a short video sequence, where the avatar is generated from a real image. Here, the transition between the sequences is seamless, resulting in a continuous movement of the avatar during the conversation. Results: The learning success by practicing with ViPATalk was tested in an anamnestic interview with actors as simulated patients. The completeness of the conversation was evaluated with regard to numerous aspects and also certain behaviors during the conversation. These results were compared with those after practicing using peer role play. Conclusions: It was found that practicing with ViPATalk was mostly equivalent to the students' role play. In the subsequent survey of the students, the wish was expressed that the ViPATalk software should also be used as an online tool for self-study and that there should be more cases for practicing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Training in social-verbal interactions is crucial for medical first responders (MFRs) to assess a patient’s condition and perform urgent treatment during emergency medical service administration. Integrating conversational agents (CAs) in virtual patients (VPs), that is, digital simulations, is a cost-effective alternative to resource-intensive human role-playing. There is moderate evidence that CAs improve communication skills more effectively when used with instructional interventions. However, more recent GPT-based artificial intelligence (AI) produces richer, more diverse, and more natural responses than previous CAs and has control of prosodic voice qualities like pitch and duration. These functionalities have the potential to better match the interaction expectations of MFRs regarding habitability. Objective: We aimed to study how the integration of GPT-based AI in a mixed reality (MR)–VP could support communication training of MFRs. Methods: We developed an MR simulation of a traffic accident with a VP. ChatGPT (OpenAI) was integrated into the VP and prompted with verified characteristics of accident victims. MFRs (N=24) were instructed on how to interact with the MR scenario. After assessing and treating the VP, the MFRs were administered the Mean Opinion Scale-Expanded, version 2, and the Subjective Assessment of Speech System Interfaces questionnaires to study their perception of the voice quality and the usability of the voice interactions, respectively. Open-ended questions were asked after completing the questionnaires. The observed and logged interactions with the VP, descriptive statistics of the questionnaires, and the output of the open-ended questions are reported. Results: The usability assessment of the VP resulted in moderate positive ratings, especially in habitability (median 4.25, IQR 4-4.81) and likeability (median 4.50, IQR 3.97-5.91). Interactions were negatively affected by the approximately 3-second latency of the responses. MFRs acknowledged the naturalness of determining the physiological states of the VP through verbal communication, for example, with questions such as “Where does it hurt?” However, the question-answer dynamic in the verbal exchange with the VP and the lack of the VP’s ability to start the verbal exchange were noticed. Noteworthy insights highlighted the potential of domain-knowledge prompt engineering to steer the actions of MFRs for effective training. Conclusions: Generative AI in VPs facilitates MFRs’ training but continues to rely on instructions for effective verbal interactions. Therefore, the capabilities of the GPT-VP and a training protocol need to be communicated to trainees. Future interactions should implement triggers based on keyword recognition, the VP pointing to the hurting area, conversational turn-taking techniques, and add the ability for the VP to start a verbal exchange. Furthermore, a local AI server, chunk processing, and lowering the audio resolution of the VP’s voice could ameliorate the delay in response and allay privacy concerns. Prompting could be used in future studies to create a virtual MFR capable of assisting trainees. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Assessments of interactional competence have traditionally been limited in large-scale language assessments. The listening portion suffers from construct underrepresentation, whereas the speaking portion suffers from limited task formats such as in-person interviews or role plays. Human-delivered tasks are challenging to administer at large scales, while automated assessments are typically very narrow in their assessment of the construct because they have carried over the limitations of traditional paper-based tasks to digital formats. However, computer-based assessments do allow for more interactive, automatically administered tasks, but come with increased complexity in task creation. Large language models present new opportunities for enhanced automated item generation (AIG) processes that can create complex content types and tasks at scale that support richer assessments. Methods: This paper describes the use of such methods to generate content at scale for an interactive listening measure of interactional competence for the Duolingo English Test (DET), a large-scale, high-stakes test of English proficiency. The Interactive Listening task assesses test takers’ ability to participate in a full conversation, resulting in a more authentic assessment of interactive listening ability than prior automated assessments by positing comprehension and interaction as purposes of listening. Results and discussion: The results of a pilot of 713 tasks with hundreds of responses per task, along with the results of human review, demonstrate the feasibility of a human-in-the-loop, generative AI-driven approach for automatic creation of complex educational assessments at scale. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Part-of-speech tagging is one of the basic tasks in the field of natural language processing, and the tagging effect has a great impact on subsequent research tasks such as syntactic analysis, information extraction and machine translation. In the field of corpus part-of-speech tagging, RNN has obvious advantages over traditional statistical machine learning methods in terms of tagging accuracy and speed. Based on the theory and method of deep learning and RNN, this paper firstly studies the part-of-speech tagging language model and algorithm, including N-gram language model, language model evaluation method and parameter smoothing algorithm. Then, the annotation process based on recurrent neural network is studied, and the backpropagation algorithm of RNN in corpus annotation is deeply studied. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out, and the results show that the part-of-speech tagging algorithm based on RNN has obvious advantages over other deep learning models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: While large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard have shown significant promise in various fields, their broader impact on enhancing patient health care access and quality, particularly in specialized domains such as oral health, requires comprehensive evaluation. Objective: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of Google Bard, ChatGPT-3.5, and ChatGPT-4 in offering recommendations for common oral health issues, benchmarked against responses from human dental experts. Methods: This comparative analysis used 40 questions derived from patient surveys on prevalent oral diseases, which were executed in a simulated clinical environment. Responses, obtained from both human experts and LLMs, were subject to a blinded evaluation process by experienced dentists and lay users, focusing on readability, appropriateness, harmlessness, comprehensiveness, intent capture, and helpfulness. Additionally, the stability of artificial intelligence responses was also assessed by submitting each question 3 times under consistent conditions. Results: Google Bard excelled in readability but lagged in appropriateness when compared to human experts (mean 8.51, SD 0.37 vs mean 9.60, SD 0.33; P=.03). ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, however, performed comparably with human experts in terms of appropriateness (mean 8.96, SD 0.35 and mean 9.34, SD 0.47, respectively), with ChatGPT-4 demonstrating the highest stability and reliability. Furthermore, all 3 LLMs received superior harmlessness scores comparable to human experts, with lay users finding minimal differences in helpfulness and intent capture between the artificial intelligence models and human responses. Conclusions: LLMs, particularly ChatGPT-4, show potential in oral health care, providing patient-centric information for enhancing patient education and clinical care. The observed performance variations underscore the need for ongoing refinement and ethical considerations in health care settings. Future research focuses on developing strategies for the safe integration of LLMs in health care settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Medical documentation plays a crucial role in clinical practice, facilitating accurate patient management and communication among health care professionals. However, inaccuracies in medical notes can lead to miscommunication and diagnostic errors. Additionally, the demands of documentation contribute to physician burnout. Although intermediaries like medical scribes and speech recognition software have been used to ease this burden, they have limitations in terms of accuracy and addressing provider-specific metrics. The integration of ambient artificial intelligence (AI)–powered solutions offers a promising way to improve documentation while fitting seamlessly into existing workflows. Objective: This study aims to assess the accuracy and quality of Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) notes generated by ChatGPT-4, an AI model, using established transcripts of History and Physical Examination as the gold standard. We seek to identify potential errors and evaluate the model’s performance across different categories. Methods: We conducted simulated patient-provider encounters representing various ambulatory specialties and transcribed the audio files. Key reportable elements were identified, and ChatGPT-4 was used to generate SOAP notes based on these transcripts. Three versions of each note were created and compared to the gold standard via chart review; errors generated from the comparison were categorized as omissions, incorrect information, or additions. We compared the accuracy of data elements across versions, transcript length, and data categories. Additionally, we assessed note quality using the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI) scoring system. Results: Although ChatGPT-4 consistently generated SOAP-style notes, there were, on average, 23.6 errors per clinical case, with errors of omission (86\%) being the most common, followed by addition errors (10.5\%) and inclusion of incorrect facts (3.2\%). There was significant variance between replicates of the same case, with only 52.9\% of data elements reported correctly across all 3 replicates. The accuracy of data elements varied across cases, with the highest accuracy observed in the “Objective” section. Consequently, the measure of note quality, assessed by PDQI, demonstrated intra- and intercase variance. Finally, the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 was inversely correlated to both the transcript length (P=.05) and the number of scorable data elements (P=.05). Conclusions: Our study reveals substantial variability in errors, accuracy, and note quality generated by ChatGPT-4. Errors were not limited to specific sections, and the inconsistency in error types across replicates complicated predictability. Transcript length and data complexity were inversely correlated with note accuracy, raising concerns about the model’s effectiveness in handling complex medical cases. The quality and reliability of clinical notes produced by ChatGPT-4 do not meet the standards required for clinical use. Although AI holds promise in health care, caution should be exercised before widespread adoption. Further research is needed to address accuracy, variability, and potential errors. ChatGPT-4, while valuable in various applications, should not be considered a safe alternative to human-generated clinical documentation at this time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

These methods are crucial for replicating real user interactions, enabling applications like synthetic data augmentation, error detection, and robust evaluation. However, existing approaches often rely on rigid rule-based methods or on annotated data. This paper introduces DAUS, a Domain-Aware User Simulator. Leveraging large language models, we fine-tune DAUS on real examples of task-oriented dialogues. Results on two relevant benchmarks showcase significant improvements in terms of user goal fulfillment. Notably, we have observed that fine-tuning enhances the simulator's coherence with user goals, effectively mitigating hallucinations - a major source of inconsistencies in simulator responses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: A chatbot is a computer program that is designed to simulate conversation with humans. Chatbots may offer rapid, responsive, and private contraceptive information; counseling; and linkages to products and services, which could improve contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Objective: This review aimed to systematically collate and interpret evidence to determine whether and how chatbots improve contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors include access to contraceptive information, understanding of contraceptive information, access to contraceptive services, contraceptive uptake, contraceptive continuation, and contraceptive communication or negotiation skills. A secondary aim of the review is to identify and summarize best practice recommendations for chatbot development to improve contraceptive outcomes, including the cost-effectiveness of chatbots where evidence is available. Methods: We systematically searched peer-reviewed and gray literature (2010-2022) for papers that evaluated chatbots offering contraceptive information and services. Sources were included if they featured a chatbot and addressed an element of contraception, for example, uptake of hormonal contraceptives. Literature was assessed for methodological quality using appropriate quality assessment tools. Data were extracted from the included sources using a data extraction framework. A narrative synthesis approach was used to collate qualitative evidence as quantitative evidence was too sparse for a quantitative synthesis to be carried out. Results: We identified 15 sources, including 8 original research papers and 7 gray literature papers. These sources included 16 unique chatbots. This review found the following evidence on the impact and efficacy of chatbots: a large, robust randomized controlled trial suggests that chatbots have no effect on intention to use contraception; a small, uncontrolled cohort study suggests increased uptake of contraception among adolescent girls; and a development report, using poor-quality methods, suggests no impact on improved access to services. There is also poor-quality evidence to suggest increased contraceptive knowledge from interacting with chatbot content. User engagement was mixed, with some chatbots reaching wide audiences and others reaching very small audiences. User feedback suggests that chatbots may be experienced as acceptable, convenient, anonymous, and private, but also as incompetent, inconvenient, and unsympathetic. The best practice guidance on the development of chatbots to improve contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors is consistent with that in the literature on chatbots in other health care fields. Conclusions: We found limited and conflicting evidence on chatbots to improve contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Further research that examines the impact of chatbot interventions in comparison with alternative technologies, acknowledges the varied and changing nature of chatbot interventions, and seeks to identify key features associated with improved contraceptive outcomes is needed. The limitations of this review include the limited evidence available on this topic, the lack of formal evaluation of chatbots in this field, and the lack of standardized definition of what a chatbot is. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Natural language processing (NLP) holds promise to transform psychiatric research and practice. A pertinent example is the success of NLP in the automatic detection of speech disorganization in formal thought disorder (FTD). However, we lack an understanding of precisely what common NLP metrics measure and how they relate to theoretical accounts of FTD. We propose tackling these questions by using deep generative language models to simulate FTD-like narratives by perturbing computational parameters instantiating theory-based mechanisms of FTD. Methods: We simulated FTD-like narratives using Generative-Pretrained-Transformer-2 by either increasing word selection stochasticity or limiting the model's memory span. We then examined the sensitivity of common NLP measures of derailment (semantic distance between consecutive words or sentences) and tangentiality (how quickly meaning drifts away from the topic) in detecting and dissociating the 2 underlying impairments. Results: Both parameters led to narratives characterized by greater semantic distance between consecutive sentences. Conversely, semantic distance between words was increased by increasing stochasticity, but decreased by limiting memory span. An NLP measure of tangentiality was uniquely predicted by limited memory span. The effects of limited memory span were nonmonotonic in that forgetting the global context resulted in sentences that were semantically closer to their local, intermediate context. Finally, different methods for encoding the meaning of sentences varied dramatically in performance. Conclusions: This work validates a simulation-based approach as a valuable tool for hypothesis generation and mechanistic analysis of NLP markers in psychiatry. To facilitate dissemination of this approach, we accompany the paper with a hands-on Python tutorial. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, these models frequently lack foresight, handling answers one by one without considering long-term consequences. Traditional NLP techniques included reinforcement learning to address this. Deep reinforcement learning predicts future rewards in chatbot talks, according to this study. The model simulates agent interactions using policy gradient approaches, prioritizing sequences with essential conversational characteristics such as informativeness and coherence. Variety, answer length, and human assessment are emphasized in the evaluation of dialogue simulations, demonstrating the potential for interesting, protracted talks.

	abstract = {Background: Chatbots have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, enabling natural language conversations with users through various modes of communication. Chatbots have the potential to play a significant role in promoting health and well-being. As the number of studies and available products related to chatbots continues to rise, there is a critical need to assess product features to enhance the design of chatbots that effectively promote health and behavioral change. Objective: This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current state of health-related chatbots, including the chatbots' characteristics and features, user backgrounds, communication models, relational building capacity, personalization, interaction, responses to suicidal thoughts, and users' in-app experiences during chatbot use. Through this analysis, we seek to identify gaps in the current research, guide future directions, and enhance the design of health-focused chatbots. Methods: Following the scoping review methodology by Arksey and O'Malley and guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist, this study used a two-pronged approach to identify relevant chatbots: (1) searching the iOS and Android App Stores and (2) reviewing scientific literature through a search strategy designed by a librarian. Overall, 36 chatbots were selected based on predefined criteria from both sources. These chatbots were systematically evaluated using a comprehensive framework developed for this study, including chatbot characteristics, user backgrounds, building relational capacity, personalization, interaction models, responses to critical situations, and user experiences. Ten coauthors were responsible for downloading and testing the chatbots, coding their features, and evaluating their performance in simulated conversations. The testing of all chatbot apps was limited to their free-to-use features. Results: This review provides an overview of the diversity of health-related chatbots, encompassing categories such as mental health support, physical activity promotion, and behavior change interventions. Chatbots use text, animations, speech, images, and emojis for communication. The findings highlight variations in conversational capabilities, including empathy, humor, and personalization. Notably, concerns regarding safety, particularly in addressing suicidal thoughts, were evident. Approximately 44\% (16/36) of the chatbots effectively addressed suicidal thoughts. User experiences and behavioral outcomes demonstrated the potential of chatbots in health interventions, but evidence remains limited. Conclusions: This scoping review underscores the significance of chatbots in health-related applications and offers insights into their features, functionalities, and user experiences. This study contributes to advancing the understanding of chatbots' role in digital health interventions, thus paving the way for more effective and user-centric health promotion strategies. This study informs future research directions, emphasizing the need for rigorous randomized control trials, standardized evaluation metrics, and user-centered design to unlock the full potential of chatbots in enhancing health and well-being. Future research should focus on addressing limitations, exploring real-world user experiences, and implementing robust data security and privacy measures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Social skills training by human trainers is a well-established method of teaching appropriate social and communication skills and strengthening social self-efficacy. Specifically, human social skills training is a fundamental approach to teaching and learning the rules of social interaction. However, it is cost-ineffective and offers low accessibility, since the number of professional trainers is limited. A conversational agent is a system that can communicate with a human being in a natural language. We proposed to overcome the limitations of current social skills training with conversational agents. Our system is capable of speech recognition, response selection, and speech synthesis and can also generate nonverbal behaviors. We developed a system that incorporated automated social skills training that completely adheres to the training model of Bellack et al through a conversational agent. Objective: This study aimed to validate the training effect of a conversational agent–based social skills training system in members of the general population during a 4-week training session. We compare 2 groups (with and without training) and hypothesize that the trained group’s social skills will improve. Furthermore, this study sought to clarify the effect size for future larger-scale evaluations, including a much larger group of different social pathological phenomena. Methods: For the experiment, 26 healthy Japanese participants were separated into 2 groups, where we hypothesized that group 1 (system trained) will make greater improvement than group 2 (nontrained). System training was done as a 4-week intervention where the participants visit the examination room every week. Each training session included social skills training with a conversational agent for 3 basic skills. We evaluated the training effect using questionnaires in pre- and posttraining evaluations. In addition to the questionnaires, we conducted a performance test that required the social cognition and expression of participants in new role-play scenarios. Blind ratings by third-party trainers were made by watching recorded role-play videos. A nonparametric Wilcoxson Rank Sum test was performed for each variable. Improvement between pre- and posttraining evaluations was used to compare the 2 groups. Moreover, we compared the statistical significance from the questionnaires and ratings between the 2 groups. Results: Of the 26 recruited participants, 18 completed this experiment: 9 in group 1 and 9 in group 2. Those in group 1 achieved significant improvement in generalized self-efficacy (P=.02; effect size r=0.53). We also found a significant decrease in state anxiety presence (P=.04; r=0.49), measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). For ratings by third-party trainers, speech clarity was significantly strengthened in group 1 (P=.03; r=0.30). Conclusions: Our findings reveal the usefulness of the automated social skills training after a 4-week training period. This study confirms a large effect size between groups on generalized self-efficacy, state anxiety presence, and speech clarity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Building dialogue systems requires a large corpus of annotated dialogues. Such datasets are usually created via crowdsourcing, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose DIALOGIC, a novel dialogue simulation method based on large language model in-context learning to automate dataset creation. Seeded with a few annotated dialogues, DIALOGIC automatically selects in-context examples for demonstration and prompts GPT-3 to generate new dialogues and annotations in a controllable way. Our method can rapidly expand a small set of dialogue data with minimum or zero human involvement and parameter update and is thus much more cost-efficient and time-saving than crowdsourcing. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ dataset demonstrate that training a model on the simulated dialogues leads to even better performance than using the same amount of human-generated dialogues under the challenging low-resource settings, with as few as 85 dialogues as a seed. When enough data is available, our method can still serve as an effective data augmentation method. Human evaluation results also show that our simulated dialogues have near-human fluency and annotation accuracy.

However, the ubiquitous personal mobile devices (smartphones) and the advent of AI-powered mobile apps equipped with automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech present novel solutions to overcome these hurdles. This study investigates the effects of an AI-powered mobile application (Liulishuo) on Chinese undergraduate EFL students’ speaking performance, using features such as automatic feedback, process-oriented monitoring, and tailored instructions. Employing a quasi-experimental design, this 10-week study was conducted at a Chinese university with two groups of participants. The control group (n = 31) engaged with WeChat for after-class assignments, whereas the experimental group (n = 32) supplemented WeChat use with Liulishuo, diversifying their educational tools. Results indicated that participants in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group regarding overall speaking performance. More specifically, notable improvements were observed in pronunciation and fluency, while vocabulary and grammar enhancements were not statistically significant. These findings underscore the capacity of AI-powered mobile apps to enhance EFL speaking performance, signaling novel pathways for the evolution of language education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Effective pronunciation instruction is essential for improving EFL learners’ communicative competence and overall learning satisfaction. However, traditional classroom practices often lack consistent, individualized feedback, limiting learners’ progress—especially in developing accurate pronunciation. While AI-powered tools have shown promise in informal L2 learning, few empirical studies have examined their integration into structured EFL pronunciation instruction—particularly classroom-based applications of intelligent CALL (ICALL) tools such as ChatGPT, a generative language model, and SpeechAce, an automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based feedback system. This study addresses this gap by investigating the effects of integrating these tools into classroom instruction to improve EFL learners’ pronunciation accuracy—specifically, segmental features (phoneme accuracy) and suprasegmental features (word stress patterns)—and L2 motivation, including Current L2 Self, Ideal L2 Self, and Intended Learning Effort. A sequential mixed-methods design was employed with 71 undergraduate EFL learners in Saudi Arabia. Quantitative results showed significant improvements in segmental pronunciation (phoneme accuracy at both word and sentence levels), with limited gains in suprasegmental stress patterns. Motivation increased significantly in Current L2 Self and Learning Effort; however, no significant within-group change was found in Ideal L2 Self, likely due to the experimental group’s slightly higher baseline score. Qualitative findings supported these trends, with students reporting positive perceptions of AI tools, citing real-time feedback, personalized practice, and increased engagement. This study contributes empirical evidence to the growing field of AI-assisted pronunciation instruction and supports the pedagogical viability of integrating tool-enhanced feedback into structured EFL contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

AI has advanced significantly since 2011, most noticeably with the 2022 release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which made chatbots powered by generative AI more widely available. AI has led to new applications in pronunciation apps that can evaluate pronunciation and integrate communicative role-play activities. This article examines ASR and chatbot integration in three iOS apps: ELSA Speak, Loora, and Vocal Image. Feedback provided by these apps is frequently inaccurate and often limited to consonant and vowel sounds.

Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected from 366 EFL learners across five universities through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The findings reveal that EAP Talk significantly enhances speaking skills, including pronunciation, grammar accuracy, idea-organization, read-aloud, and presentation skills. Participants appreciated the convenience, motivational aspects, and institutional efficiency of EAP Talk, which allowed for flexible and autonomous learning. However, several limitations were identified. Issues with the accuracy of voice recognition and score feedback affected learners' confidence in the feedback. The relevance of practice materials to academic courses was another concern, as was the limited detail in the feedback provided by EAP Talk, which often lacked comprehensive explanations and corrective guidance. The absence of feedback on grammar accuracy and speech organization further limited the tool's effectiveness for developing comprehensive speaking proficiency. These findings suggest that while EAP Talk holds significant potential for enhancing language learning, ongoing improvements are necessary to address its limitations.

	abstract = {Computer-assisted Language Learning (CALL) is a rapidly developing area accelerated by advancements in the field of AI. A well-designed and reliable CALL system allows students to practice language skills, like pronunciation, any time outside of the classroom. Furthermore, gamification via mobile applications has shown encouraging results on learning outcomes and motivates young users to practice more and perceive language learning as a positive experience. In this work, we adapt the latest speech recognition technology to be a part of an online pronunciation training system for small children. As part of our gamified mobile application, our models will assess the pronunciation quality of young Swedish children diagnosed with Speech Sound Disorder, and participating in speech therapy. Additionally, the models provide feedback to young non-native children learning to pronounce Swedish and Finnish words. Our experiments revealed that these new models fit into an online game as they function as speech recognizers and pronunciation evaluators simultaneously. To make our systems more trustworthy and explainable, we investigated whether the combination of modern input attribution algorithms and time-aligned transcripts can explain the decisions made by the models, give us insights into how the models work and provide a tool to develop more reliable solutions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To promote language learning performance, a realistic speech mission-based digital learning theater, which integrates with real-time spoken language evaluation and interactive switching of scenario and virtual costumes, was proposed in this study. Regarding evaluation, an AI chatbot is integrated into the digital learning theater to assign speech tasks to learners and evaluate their performance in terms of pronunciation and grammar, and then provide immediate feedback for improvement. Regarding interaction, with Kinect motion detection technology, learners can immerse themselves into the digital scene of drama with their whole body and wear various virtual costumes that can automatically match learners' body size and motions, to strengthen learners' interest and engagement in learning. This study was conducted on a Japanese language course for university students. The results suggest that students' learning outcomes and motivation can be enhanced with realistic speech mission-based digital learning theater. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite the large amount of leadership and implementation theories and recommendations, healthcare services continue to struggle with efficiently incorporating new knowledge. The questioning of conventional leadership approaches in healthcare organizations prompted us to investigate how frontline leaders comprehend their own implementation intentions and actions, and how these intentions and actions may impact the implementation of clinical guidelines in mental healthcare in Norway. Methods: Employing a theory-driven qualitative design, we conducted nine semi-structured interviews with frontline leaders who had recently led implementation of clinical guidelines for the treatment of psychosis in mental health. We employed Systematic Text Condensation, informed by Normalization Process Theory, to structure and analyze the data and used fidelity scales to measure the degree of implementation and distinguish between leaders' levels of success in implementation. Results: Frontline leaders in units that achieved high success in implementation described their intentions and actions differently, from those with less success. The former group's actions aligned more closely with the constructs of the Normalization Process Theory compared to the latter group when describing their actions. Frontline leaders leading units with a high degree of implementation success describe relation-orientation, trust, and providing adaptive space for staff members to take initiative. In contrast, those leading units with less implementation success describe more control and guidance of co-operators and place more emphasize on information and knowledge. Conclusion: Differences in how frontline leaders describe their actions and intentions to achieve clinical guideline implementation suggest that the leadership approach of these frontline leaders is an important factor to consider when planning and conducting implementation. To better understand the implementation process, it is important to pay attention to how frontline leaders customize their leadership approaches to the dynamics of complex organizations, and how they interact with their team and superiors. Plain Language Summary: Despite the large amount of available implementation theories and recommendations, healthcare services continue to struggle with efficiently incorporating new and better practice. The clinicians' closest leader, the Frontline leader, is considered to be in a unique position to manage and enable implementation in the complex healthcare system. The current study's aim was to improve our understanding of what these leaders do, and how they operate, to enable the implementation of clinical guidelines. We interviewed nine mental health service leaders in Norway with experience of leading implementation of clinical guideline during the last 3 years. We found a variety of leaders' intentions and actions regarding their involvement in the process and how they relate to their staff and superiors. Frontline leaders that lead units with high degree of implementation success described actions according to all four constructs of the Normalization Process Theory (Coherence, Cognitive participation, Collective action and Reflexive monitoring), while frontline leaders with less implementation success had more fragmented descriptions. Successful leaders appear to be more relation-oriented compared to those in less successful units. This suggests that leaders should focus on inter-personal dynamics, in addition to more concrete implementation interventions, to succeed. We recommend to take the leadership actions and intentions identified in this study into consideration when planning and evaluating implementation projects and leadership programs, as well as when recruiting frontline leaders.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE Every year during the open enrollment period, hundreds of thousands of individuals across the Affordable Care Act marketplaces begin the enrollment process but fail to complete it, thereby resulting in coverage gaps or going uninsured. OBJECTIVE To investigate if low-cost (\$0.55 per person) letters can increase health insurance enrollment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This intent-to-treat randomized clinical trial was conducted during the final 2 weeks of the 2015 open enrollment period among the 37 states on the HealthCare.gov platform. The trial targeted 744510 individuals who started the enrollment process but had yet to complete it. Data were analyzed from January through August 2021. INTERVENTIONS Study participants were randomized to either a no-letter control group or to 1 of 8 letter variants that drew on evidence from the behavioral sciences about what motivates individuals to take action. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the health insurance enrollment rate at the end of the open enrollment period. RESULTS Of the 744510 individuals (mean [SD] age, 41.9 [19.6] years; 53.9\% women). 136 122 (18.3\%) were in the control group and 608 388 (81.7\%) were in the treatment group. Most lived in Medicaid nonexpansion states (72.7\%), and a plurality were between 30 and 50 years old (41.0\%). For race and ethnicity, 3.0\% self-identified as Asian, 14.0\% as Black, 5.1\% as Hispanic, 39.8\% as non-Hispanic White, and 38.2\% as other or unknown. By the end of the open enrollment period, 4.0\% of the control group enrolled in health insurance coverage. Comparatively, the enrollment rate in the pooled treatment group was 4.3\%, which demonstrated an increase of 0.3 percentage points (95\% CI, 0.2-0.4 percentage points; P{\textless}.001). yielding 1753 marginal enrollments. Letters that used action language caused larger enrollment effects, particularly among Black individuals (increase of 1.6 percentage points; 95\% CI, 0.6-2.7 percentage points; P= .003) and Hispanic individuals (increase of 1.5 percentage points; 95\% CI, 0.0-3.0 percentage points; P = .046) in Medicaid expansion states. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This randomized clinical trial shows that letters designed with best practices from the behavioral sciences literature were a low-cost way to increase health insurance enrollment in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. More research is needed to understand what messages are most effective amid the recently passed American Rescue Plan.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) often advise adult patients to complete at-home programs in order to improve outcomes. Despite this widespread practice, relatively little is known about treatment adherence. The purposes of this systematic review were to identify adherence strategies and adherence tracking methods used by adult populations that are commonly treated by SLPs (i.e., dysphagia, aphasia, traumatic brain injury, dysphonia, dysarthria), and to identify the efficacy of these strategies. Method: The systematic review was conducted in accordance with A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed in three databases (CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science). Results: Of the 679 articles found, 18 were selected for analysis. Two thirds of the included articles received the second highest rating on the 5-point JAMA Quality Rating Scheme. Interventions designed to alter treatment adherence included (most to least frequent) computer programs, portable devices/phone apps, alarm reminders, instructional DVDs, check-ins from a clinician/volunteer, and wearable device. Adherence reporting methods included (most to least frequent) self-report diaries, computer program/app-aided collection, wearable device, and clinician/volunteer observation. Of the articles that reported practice frequency, 58\% found that adherence strategies improved practice frequency as compared to control. Of the articles that reported treatment outcomes, 66\% found that adherence strategies were associated with improved treatment outcomes as compared to control. Conclusions: The paucity of publications reviewed suggests that treatment adherence is considerably understudied in speech-language pathology. A clearer understanding of how to improve the design of adherence strategies could yield highly valuable clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {This review aimed to synthesize factors associated with medication nonadherence among people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D), using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model as the a priori model. Studies published between January 2014 and April 2024 were searched on five databases. Studies were included if they recruited PwT2D aged {\textgreater}18 years, investigated factors associated with adherence to oral and/or nonoral medications for diabetes, used qualitative research methods, were conducted in a community setting, were in English language and had accessible full-text articles. Best fit framework synthesis was undertaken, which led to the development of a hypothesized COM-B variant model specific to medication nonadherence among PwT2D. Study quality was assessed using published criteria to evaluate whether the study was adequately reported. Twenty-two studies were included. Factors were mapped onto the COM-B model: physical capability (e.g., difficulty injecting insulin independently), psychological capability (e.g., understanding about diabetes), physical opportunity (e.g., cost of medication), social opportunity (e.g., quality of communication and relationship with healthcare providers), automatic motivation (e.g., habit formation) and reflective motivation (e.g., perceived necessity and effectiveness of medications). Reflective motivation had the most themes, while physical capability only had one theme. Personality was a theme that could not be mapped onto the model. Interactions between some COM-B components (e.g., capability and motivation) were observed. This theoretically grounded synthesis may facilitate future intervention development by formulating a programme theory and identifying behaviour change techniques to address the identified factors.},

Qualitative analyses of transcripts of the initial three sessions and client posttreatment interviews were integrated into a combined analysis to identify themes across the two separate sets of findings. Results: Therapist future-oriented activity included: (1) Picking up explicit and implicit intentions; (2) using linguistic devices, such as meta-communication, action language, and hedging; (3) using evocative interventions; and (4) nudging the client into practicing change.

	abstract = {Cause-related marketing is commonly regarded as an effective tool for tourism enterprises to bolster their commitment to sustainable practices, fostering environmental and social responsibility within their operations and offerings. However, despite this, there is limited research into the implementation of cause-related social marketing to achieve the sustainability goals of tourism enterprises. Consequently, this research leverages construal level theory to examine how goal framing in cause-related tourism marketing communications nudges consumers towards engaging in prosocial behaviours, with an explicit emphasis on the boundary conditions in which desired effects diminish. Results across two pilot studies and four scenario-based experiments demonstrate that the specific (vs. abstract) goal framing elicits a higher degree of prosocial behaviours through the critical role of empathy. Two moderating variables demonstrate the enhancement effect of specific goal framing is attenuated for consumers already high (vs. low) on the agreeableness trait and those who are primed with a cyclical (vs. linear) temporal perspective. Additional analyses and controls, including ruling out three alternative explanations, reinforce the reliability and validity of the results. This research provides evidence-based insights critical to amplify the effectiveness of cause-related corporate social responsibility initiatives in tourism, unveiling the specific mechanisms which underpin consumer responses to corporate social responsibility messages and communication framing. Future research should examine the critical role of goal framing in the social repositioning of tourism enterprises.},

	abstract = {Digital technology has had an unavoidable impact on business, which, in turn, has led to changes in social areas. For example, digital innovations in business can result in people being made redundant, i.e. losing their jobs. It is an inescapable fact that employment (or the lack of it) has huge effects on society. The big data of modern AI drives big changes, changes which can be frighteningly fast. We (the instigators of change) are not even always sure whether we made the decisions ourselves or whether we were nudged in a certain direction. The exigencies of the current global business environment have led to the implementation of a plethora of innovative AI applications for finance, behavioral biometrics and even Natural Language Understanding (NLU). These are powerful tools, but there has been no independent and coordinated assessment of the very real risks these AI technologies may precipitate, at least not in terms of specific working environments. All the aforementioned threats (and opportunities) are newcomers from the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore, it is vital to review the role that AI plays in the life of any business enterprise. One problem is that many enterprises are early adopters of AI and thus may be over-reliant on artificial intelligence while not fully understanding the knock-on effects that it can have on a company's business model. In contrast to the early-adopters of AI, there are some businesses whose more conservative management style has not yet introduced the latest AI technologies into their business practices. Such businesses are waiting for the appropriate AI tools to be developed which would ensure their business a competitive advantage and thus justify their investment. Finally, there are many enterprises that have the capacity for AI implementation but cannot be sure whether the company will benefit from it, or whether AI technology might contain the seeds of the company's collapse. For such companies, the benefits of AI have to be clear, so more research is needed to persuade these reluctant recruits to join the AI revolution. Without up-to-date and accurate research, we cannot affirm the success of AI implementation. Therefore, the objective of this research is to highlight the correlation between pre-benefits and benefits for an enterprise implementing AI to develop its business. The aims of this study are threefold: to identify and summarize the pre-benefits an enterprise already has when integrating AI into its practices, to predict any possible disruptions to the enterprise's business during the AI integration process, and to evaluate the consequences of a specific AI implementation for a company in terms of the number and quality of any pre-benefits it has. The study concludes with a summary showing the pros and cons of AI applications for companies with pre-benefits, and a summary of the benefits that could be obtained as a result of a certain implementation.},

	abstract = {Smoke Sense is a citizen science project with investigative, educational, and action-oriented objectives at the intersection of wildland fire smoke and public health. Participants engage with a smartphone application to explore current and forecast visualizations of air quality, learn about how to protect health from wildfire smoke, and record their smoke experiences, health symptoms, and behaviors taken to reduce their exposures to smoke. Through participation in the project, individuals engage in observing changes in their environment and recording changes in their health, thus facilitating progression on awareness of health effects of air pollution and adoption of desired health-promoting behaviors. Participants can also view what others are reporting. Data from the pilot season (1 August 2017 to 7 January 2018; 5,598 downloads) suggest that there is a clear demand for personally relevant data during wildfire episodes motivated by recognition of environmental hazard and the personal concern for health. However, while participants shared clear perceptions of the environmental hazard and health risks in general, they did not consistently recognize their own personal health risk. The engagement in health protective behavior was driven in response to symptoms rather than as preventive courses of action. We also observed clear differences in the adoption likelihood of various health protective behaviors attributed to barriers and perceived benefits of these actions. As users experience a greater number and severity of symptoms, the perceived benefits of taking health protective actions exceeded the costs associated with the barriers and thus increased adoption of those actions. Based on pilot season data, we summarize key insights which may improve current health risk communications in nudging individuals toward health protective behavior; there is a need to increase personal awareness of risk and compelling evidence that health protective behaviors are beneficial. Plain Language Summary An observed increase in wildfire smoke exposure highlights the need for best practices in promoting protective health behaviors during wildfire smoke events. Understanding perceptions, motivations, and barriers to behavioral change (physical, social, or financial) among impacted individuals can provide insights into how to improve health risk communication and achieve better public health outcomes during smoke events. However, almost nothing is known about how current recommendations are perceived, adopted, and adhered to by individuals impacted by smoke. Smoke Sense is a citizen science project which aims to engage participants by encouraging them to observe their environment and record changes in their health, thus facilitating progression on awareness of health effects of air pollution and adoption of desired health-promoting behaviors. We examined the feasibility of engaging smartphone users in a citizen science study and investigated the range of behavioral responses taken when experiencing smoke and health symptoms. Based on pilot season data, we suggest that to nudge individuals toward adopting health protective behaviors, we need to increase health risk awareness and provide compelling evidence that health protective behaviors are beneficial.},

Achieving automaticity allows learners to progress from laborious language use to fluent, real-time communication by freeing limited cognitive resources. This research timeline synthesizes four decades of laboratory and classroom research on automatization, bridging cognitive learning theories with pedagogical practice. We trace five key research strands: (1) cognitive mechanisms, including the explicit-implicit knowledge interface; (2) skill development trajectories across phonological, lexical, morphosyntax, and pragmatics domains; (3) instructional approaches promoting automatization of knowledge and skills through deliberate and systematic practice; (4) methodological advances in measuring automaticity (e.g., reaction time, coefficient of variation, neural measures); and (5) individual differences in long-term memory systems (declarative and procedural memory). This timeline offers a comprehensive perspective on how automatization research has significantly advanced our understanding of L2 learning.},

Given that the current professional literature enjoys a vast selection of high-quality, comprehensive books on second language acquisition, the purpose of this article is to provide a concise yet overarching summary of the most pivotal aspects of second language acquisition research and their implementation in L2 teaching. The article provides theoretical background on linguistic factors involved in L2 learning (exposure and input, output, vocabulary, repetition, and automaticity) and extralinguistic factors (attitudes, motivation, culture, and the teaching/learning experience). Following the description of the theoretical background, pedagogical implications are suggested for each of the theoretical points covered.

Studies in Second Language Acquisition, 20, 349-385) taxonomy of communicative strategies is employed as the analytical framework for the present investigation. The qualitative observations reveal that the general categorical variations of stalling strategy in our participants' L1 and L2 discourse are indistinguishable, manifesting the universality of linguistic communicative strategies. Yet, participants are found to be less proficient at utilizing L2 fillers than the L1 equivalents with respect to variation. Such phenomenon should be greatly attributed to language specificity of the lexicalized stalling devices and the paucity of authentic L2 stimuli the participants received. The quantitative results indicate that the frequency of stalling devices increases along with the decrease of the speakers' automaticity of language processing. Specifically, the frequency of L2 stalling strategies is about two times higher than that of its L1 equivalents. The quantitative results further reinforce that L2 processing is less automatic than L1 processing. In brief, both the qualitative and quantitative findings evidence a tight correlation between the speakers' communication strategic competence and their linguistic proficiency. Finally, some insights into the teaching of non-native stalling strategies for language learners are provided.},

The contribution of these conflicts has been investigated with color word distracters. This is the first study which explores how two types of first- and second-language words affect audio-visual matching. Native French speakers performed a bilingual Stroop matching task with intermixed French (L1) and English (L2) color words (Experiment 1) and color associates (Experiment 2) presented in congruent and incongruent colors simultaneously with spoken French color words. Participants were instructed to indicate whether the spoken word "matches" or "mismatches" the font color, while ignoring written word meaning. Interestingly, the results were similar for the critical "mismatch" trials for both French and English words. The responses were the fastest on trials in which task comparisons activate fewer response alternatives, supporting the assumption of the response conflict account.},

The platform integrates deep learning, automatic speech recognition, and automatic writing evaluation. It provides automated assessment and immediate feedback on speakers' public speaking anxiety and their speaking and writing competence. Fifty-two English public speaking learners were randomly assigned to two groups. The control group (G1) undertook self-, peer, and teacher assessment via the platform, while the experimental group (G2) experienced self-, automated, and teacher assessment. The ANCOVA results revealed that students in G1 perceived significantly higher social engagement than those in G2, which indicates that social interaction between learners during peer assessment cannot be substituted by automated assessment. The chi-square analysis showed students' different concerns regarding online formative assessment. While students in G1 showed concerns for peers' qualifications and willingness to provide feedback, students in G2 suggested generating more detailed automated feedback to improve self-learning. No significant differences were found in learners' English public speaking self-efficacy, engagement, or competence. This indicates that automated assessment can serve as an effective strategy for formative assessment and that AI tools may supplement peers as reliable learning companions in the foreseeable future.},

While prior research has predominantly focused on learners, using IPAs for bilingual education (BE) teachers has received relatively little attention. The study investigated the effects of IPAs (i.e. Google Assistant) on BE teachers' L2 speaking proficiency and their perceptions of IPA-assisted L2 speaking. Thirty Taiwanese BE teachers who were L2 English speakers participated in a semester-long IPA-mediated interaction program. These teachers interacted with Google Assistant in their daily lives. Both quantitative (English speaking proficiency tests) and qualitative data (semi-structured interviews) were collected and analyzed. The results revealed that Google Assistant significantly promoted BE teachers' English-speaking proficiency. Most teachers confirmed that Google Assistant could establish an authentic environment that facilitates communication, increases English-speaking opportunities, enhances practice frequency, and provides scaffolding and immediate feedback, which contribute to their English speaking proficiency. Integrating Google Assistant into lesson preparation proved valuable, enabling teachers to access curriculum-related information efficiently and increasing their motivation to engage with IPAs.},

Another paradigm consists of using virtual characters to provide feedback through their behavior during simulated social interactions. Preliminary studies have started to explore the effectiveness of these different training paradigms; however, these have not investigated the impact of individual differences on which interaction paradigm is more efficient or motivating for different populations of users. In this article, we explore the impact of personality, public speaking anxiety, and immersive tendencies on the experiences of users training public speaking with an interactive virtual audience system providing real-time feedback through virtual audience behavior as well as delayed feedback with an after-action review tool. We found that these three factors impacted different output measures of user experience and user ratings of the system's quality.},

The fear of public speaking (FPS) is a common problem that can have a significant impact on an individual's professional and personal life. Traditional therapies for public speaking anxiety have been shown to be effective, but there is growing interest in the use of VR as an alternative or supplement to these therapies. This study aims to investigate the VR medium in improving public speaking skills and to explore the potential mechanisms underlying this effect. A framework was developed with the aim to investigate the possibility of improving public speaking skills through VR. Key features of this framework include the ability to adjust the audience size and alter the dimensions of the room. Additionally, it allows for the modification of initial audience behaviors. One of the innovative aspects is the inclusion of an evolving attention span in the virtual audience, adding a dynamic element to the VR experience. The framework excels in tracking various metrics in real time and has the audience react dynamically based on them. These metrics include movement and voice parameters. The system is designed to present this data as immediate feedback to the user, but also as a summary after a presentation has concluded. After an extensive two-phased testing, the results are discussed. These findings suggest that VR can be an effective means for improving public speaking skills and potentially helping in alleviating fear of public speaking.},

This study investigates the integration of chatbot technology into English language learning and its impact on enhancing student engagement and interactive communication skills. The research involved a random selection of participants from a university English course, aiming to assess how chatbot interactions can bolster communication skills. Data was collected through pre- and post-implementation assessments, focusing on students' speaking proficiency across various tasks. The analysis employed advanced analytical models such as t-tests to determine improvements in fluency, pronunciation, intonation, and stress patterns. A mixed-methods approach was utilized, incorporating surveys to gather students' perceptions of chatbot usage in their learning process. This procedure involved implementing chatbot interactions during the course, allowing students to practice speaking and receive immediate feedback. Results indicated significant improvements in students' overall speaking abilities, particularly in fluency and intonation. While no notable differences were observed in pronunciation between proficiency levels, substantial advancements were found in interactive speaking tasks. The findings highlight the potential of chatbot technology to improve student engagement and communication skills in English language learning. This research underscores the necessity for further exploration into innovative educational tools to support language acquisition in diverse learning environments.},

Thirty-two Turkish language teachers and 96 middle school students participated in the study, which employed a case study design, a qualitative research method. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview form and analyzed using content analysis. The findings indicated that both teachers and students perceived face-to-face instruction as more effective. Teachers favored face-to-face education due to the advantages of utilizing body language, providing immediate feedback, and employing diverse methodologies, while they considered distance education as a viable alternative for use in exigent circumstances. Although students also expressed a preference for face-to-face education, they demonstrated a more positive attitude towards distance education compared to teachers. The perception of distance education varied according to grade level. Lower grades exhibited a mask and distance-oriented approach, whereas upper grades focused on the communication environment. Notably, eighth-grade students demonstrated greater awareness of the flexibility and accessibility advantages of distance education. A significant finding revealed that some students experienced reduced anxiety in distance education. This suggests that distance education may serve as a supportive tool in developing speaking skills. However, inadequacies in technical infrastructure and communication gaps impede the effective utilization of this potential.},

	abstract = {Conversations over the telephone require timely turn-taking cues that signal the participants when to speak and when to listen. When a two-way transmission delay is introduced into such conversations, the immediate feedback is delayed, and the interactivity of the conversation is impaired. With delayed speech on each side of the transmission, different conversation realities emerge on both ends, which alters the way the participants interact with each other. Simulating conversations can give insights on turn-taking and spoken interactions between humans but can also used for analyzing and even predicting human behavior in conversations. In this paper, we simulate two types of conversations with distinct levels of interactivity. We then introduce three levels of two-way transmission delay between the agents and compare the resulting interaction-patterns with human-to-human dialog from an empirical study. We show how the turn-taking mechanisms modeled for conversations without delay perform in scenarios with delay and identify to which extend the simulation is able to model the delayed turn-taking observed in human conversation.},

However, these studies evaluated social skills training systems as a whole and it is unclear to what extent which components contributed to positive outcomes. In this paper, we describe an experimental study where we compared the relative efficacy of real-time interactive feedback and after-action feedback in the context of a public speaking training application. We observed that both components provide benefits to the overall training: the real-time interactive feedback made the experience more immersive and improved participants' motivation in using the system, while the after-action feedback led to positive training outcomes when it contained personalized feedback elements. Taken in combination, these results confirm that both social signal processing technologies and virtual social interactions are both contributing to social skills training systems' efficiency. Additionally, we observed that several individual factors, here the subjects' initial level of public speaking anxiety, personality and tendency to immersion significantly influenced the training experience. This finding suggests that social skills training systems could benefit from being tailored to participants' particular individual circumstances.},

	abstract = {The traditional methods of English oral evaluation and pronunciation optimization suffer from high subjectivity and delayed feedback. In response to this issue, this article aims to use speech recognition technology to provide objective and real-time oral evaluation and personalized pronunciation optimization guidance. Firstly, this article establishes a corpus containing rich phonetic data, including English oral samples with different accents and pronunciation characteristics. Secondly, this article adopts a DNN (deep neural network)-HMM (hidden Markov model) hybrid model for speech recognition, recognizing learners' oral expressions and analyzing pronunciation errors. Then, personalized pronunciation optimization guidance is provided based on the recognition results. Finally, this article conducts experiments to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the algorithm has made significant progress in spoken language assessment and pronunciation optimization, and the DNN-HMM model shows better performance in terms of the phonological error rate, word error rate and grammatical error rate, with the average phonological error rate, average word error rate and average grammatical error rate reaching 7.9\%, 13.3\% and 5.1\% in multiple corpora, which significantly outperforms GMM (Gaussian mixture model)-HMM model, RNNs (recurrent neural networks), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Transformer. Moreover, participants demonstrated noticeable improvements in speaking speed, and their overall scores rose significantly, reaching a fluent level after utilizing the system for pronunciation training. The integration of DNN-HMM offers a novel approach for English speaking assessment. Through precise error detection and personalized optimization recommendations, learners' pronunciation skills and overall speaking proficiency were significantly enhanced.},

The coupling scheme in Experiment 1 and that in Experiment 2 go beyond the single delayed feedback coupling used in previous research and articulations of anticipating synchronization. These advanced coupling arrangements are addressed using an extended formulation which allows for multiple feedback delays, a continuous range of delay, or even coupling to real future values. The latter case is specifically investigated in Experiment 2, which utilizes a navigation task that provides a natural way to speak about coupling to future values.},

Also, in their opinion, written assignments should be thoroughly corrected, followed by metalinguistic explanation. Overall, it can be concluded that students displayed positive attitudes regarding corrective feedback in spoken and written performance.

After six months of pronunciation improvement training, one student's pronunciation accuracy increased from 0.65 to 0.911 , while the others improved.

This program implements didactic training, role-play, and immediate feedback using a simulation approach to improve spoken language performance. The unique target of this training is a category of linguistic markers called politeness markers which are essential for cooperative workplace exchanges. Methods: We recruited eight adults with chronic traumatic brain injury. All participants demonstrated reduced politeness marker use in language sampling before treatment. This study had a quasi-experimental treatment design. We measured the rate of politeness marker use (politeness markers per minute) using the Voicemail Elicitation Task and novel role-play tasks, and the La Trobe Communication Questionnaire as outcome (dependent) variables. Results: After training, participants demonstrated an increase in trained and untrained politeness marker use that was significant for the novel role-play tasks. The La Trobe Communication Questionnaire found that familiar conversation partners reported a significant increase in social communication skills. Conclusion: The WoRC program has implications for introducing a sociolinguistic foundation for social communication training in general and specifically for vocational placement.},

Both groupings were further divided into groups of two or three students to develop oral presentations. Data collection consisted of pre- and post-tests and evaluations of the group project presentations. The control and experimental groups uploaded their projects to an online learning platform and gave brief presentations. The two teachers then evaluated students' projects. The difference between the control and experimental groups was that in addition to written feedback, the latter recorded video-mediated oral feedback, providing verbal comments regarding other teams' oral presentations. The results of this study indicated that the students in the experimental group positively perceived their learning process in the oral presentation exercise and performed better than those in the control group. They offered encouraging and immediate feedback to their peers and perceived peers' annotations, which enhanced their oral presentations in terms of fluency, content, organization, and delivery. This study suggests that EFL college students can use the video peer feedback to improve their engagement to learn during oral presentation exercises.},

In this way, all students have an equal chance to be appraised for their participation, indicated by being attentive in class. This article surveys the scholarship on one-minute papers and participation grading in political science, outlines takeaway procedures, and discusses how to adjust this technique for face-to-face and online learning environments. I suggest that takeaways ensure transparency in grading participation, enable equal opportunities to participate, encourage students' attentiveness, and create a communication channel for the exchange of immediate feedback between a professor and students.},

Order selectors in distribution centers that use voice-directed systems (listening to instructions via a headset and speaking into a microphone and receiving immediate audio feedback) were tracked for units per hour performance of products selected for store orders. The voice-directed application was enhanced with a personal performance productivity prompt so that each order selector now heard their units per hour performance after each completed store order assignment. Upon activation of the newly developed personal performance productivity prompt, selector performance increased to match and exceed the labor standards established for three warehouse zones (accessories, batteries, and tires). This is an example in which an Organizational Behavior Management (OBM) professional can play a vital role in helping large industrial settings adapt to new technologies for the workforce, in this case, for increased performance.},

This experimental study explores the efficacy of immediate computer-mediated feedback within a virtual reality environment designed to facilitate the development of pre-university students' presentation skills. Two conditions were established to assess the efficacy: immediate computer-mediated feedback; a control condition of delayed expert-mediated feedback. Results showed improvement but no statistically relevant difference in performance gains between the two conditions, suggesting both can facilitate learning. Furthermore, students perceived the environment to be an effective and motivating platform in which to practise presentation skills. For educators seeking viable alternatives to face-to-face presentation practice and feedback, the finding that immediate computer-mediated feedback is potentially as effective in aiding presentation performance is crucial for two reasons: first, it expands practice opportunities for students; second, it could result in less pressure on resources, including time and staffing.},

Elderly people are especially vulnerable to these tricks, that typically occur at the front door, street or on the phone. We have developed a virtual training environment to teach people how to handle these situations and learn them to increase their verbal resilience. The training is implemented as a tablet application and consists of six scenarios that are likely to occur in daily life. Participants are placed in a dialogue with a virtual character and may interact by choosing an answer from a fixed multiple-choice menu or by speaking the answer aloud. A speech recognition module is able to detect the level of assertiveness and provides immediate feedback to the user's performance. In this paper, we present the implementation of the virtual training application. To evaluate the prototype a focus group was organized, consisting of potential end users. The outcomes were mainly positive and the provided feedback will be incorporated into the final version.},

Auditory and visual feedback has been used in the therapy with a humanoid robot. For this purpose, the common method of "echo" was modified. The modification is that the speaker hears delayed speech sounds uttered by the robot. The sounds of speech coming from an external microphone are captured and delayed by a computer and then, using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), sent to the robot's system and played in its speakers. This system allows the elimination of negative feedback and external sound field's noise. The effect of this therapy is enhanced by the fact that, in addition to the effect, relating to the action of the delayed feedback, the speaker has company during the difficult process of speaking. Visual feedback has been realized as changes in the robot's hand movements according to the shape of the speech signal envelope and possibility of controlling speech with a metronome effect.},

The platform Moodle Cloud becomes an integral component of the language training. It is an organized system which includes online tests, review exercises and detailed corrections to allow the teacher to monitor the progresses of the participants and provide them with immediate feedback. Each participant is required to send the written exercises required in each unit (5 per level) to a specific email address. Corrections are made within two days. Each level also includes 10 tutorial hours during which the main issues will be examined, and personal abilities will be tested. The tutorial hours are necessary to improve the speaking abilities. The completion of a level normally requires a period of six weeks. Each lesson is based on a specific topic and consists of grammar explanation videos, audio comments and tests that allow the students to identify immediately any mistakes made. Teaching material can be downloaded and stored separately, and the exercises can be done iteratively. The relationship between teachers and participants as well as review and written exercises highlights a high-quality level of the results achieved by each participant (very good speaking, understanding and writing skills).

	abstract = {Sign language is the fundamental mode of communication for those who are deaf and mute, as well as for individuals with hearing impairments. Regrettably, there has been a dearth of research on Indian Sign Language, primarily due to the lack of adequate grammar and regional variations in such language. Consequently, research in this area has been limited. The primary objective of our research is to develop a sophisticated speech/ text-to-Indian sign language conversion system that employs advanced 3D modeling techniques to display sign language motions. Our research is motivated by our desire to promote effective communication between hearing and hearing- impaired individuals in India. The proposed model integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology, which effectively transforms spoken words into text, and leverages 3D modeling techniques to generate corresponding sign language motions. We have conducted a comprehensive study of the grammar of Indian Sign Language, which includes identifying sentence structure and signs that represent the tense of the subject. It is noteworthy that the sentence structure of Indian Sign Language follows the Subject-Object-Verb sequence, in contrast to spoken language, which follows the Subject-Verb-Object structure. To enhance user experience as well as digital inclusion and accessibility, the research incorporates user-friendly and simple interfaces that allow individuals to interact effortlessly with the system intuitively. The model/ system is equipped to receive speech input through a microphone/ text and provide immediate feedback through 3D-modeled videos that display the generated sign language gestures and has achieved 99.2\% accuracy. Our main goal is to promote digital inclusion and improve accessibility and enhance the user experience.},

	abstract = {High-speed photonic reservoir computing (RC) has garnered significant interest in neuromorphic computing. However, existing reservoir layer (RL) architectures mostly rely on time -delayed feedback loops and use analog -to -digital converters for offline digital processing in the implementation of the readout layer, posing inherent limitations on their speed and capabilities. In this paper, we propose a non -feedback method that utilizes the pulse broadening effect induced by optical dispersion to implement a RL. By combining the multiplication of the modulator with the summation of the pulse temporal integration of the distributed feedback -laser diode, we successfully achieve the linear regression operation of the optoelectronic analog readout layer. Our proposed fully -analog feed -forward photonic RC (FF-PhRC) system is experimentally demonstrated to be effective in chaotic signal prediction, spoken digit recognition, and MNIST classification. Additionally, using wavelength -division multiplexing, our system manages to complete parallel tasks and improve processing capability up to 10 GHz per wavelength. The present work highlights the potential of FF-PhRC as a high-performance, high-speed computing tool for real-time neuromorphic computing.

	abstract = {Gesture-speech synchrony re-stabilizes when hand movement or speech is disrupted by a delayed feedback manipulation, suggesting strong bidirectional coupling between gesture and speech. Yet it has also been argued from case studies in perceptual-motor pathology that hand gestures are a special kind of action that does not require closed-loop re-afferent feedback to maintain synchrony with speech. In the current pre-registered within-subject study, we used motion tracking to conceptually replicate McNeill's () classic study on gesture-speech synchrony under normal and 150 ms delayed auditory feedback of speech conditions (NO DAF vs. DAF). Consistent with, and extending McNeill's original results, we obtain evidence that (a) gesture-speech synchrony is more stable under DAF versus NO DAF (i.e., increased coupling effect), (b) that gesture and speech variably entrain to the external auditory delay as indicated by a consistent shift in gesture-speech synchrony offsets (i.e., entrainment effect), and (c) that the coupling effect and the entrainment effect are co-dependent. We suggest, therefore, that gesture-speech synchrony provides a way for the cognitive system to stabilize rhythmic activity under interfering conditions.},

We assessed device use, changes in speech clarity, alignment with the proposed 5-factor model, and barriers.ResultsChildren used smart speakers on average once daily for approximately 6 commands. Speech clarity ratings improved post-exposure and improvements correlated with device use. Parents noted children spoke more slowly and loudly to the device. Both parent and child reports reflected the 5-factor model, with children showing motivation, spaced engagement, and willingness to repeat commands.ConclusionsNaturalistic use of smart speakers is an acceptable and feasible tool to support speech practice in children with speech difficulties.

	abstract = {In this study, a systematic review was conducted to explore the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in language learning, drawing insights from 18 peer-reviewed articles published between 2009 and 2024. The research utilised the PRISMA framework to ensure a comprehensive, structured approach to data collection and analysis. Articles were sourced from academic databases such as Google Scholar, ERIC, and PubMed, using targeted search terms including "AI and learning speaking," "AI and learning writing," and "AI and improving listening." A meticulous screening process was applied, first by title and abstract, followed by full-text analysis to ensure relevance. The studies were then subject to a dual-round thematic analysis, with each round focusing on identifying patterns and cross-validating findings related to AI's impact on language learning outcomes. The findings of the study revealed that AI-driven tools significantly enhance language learning outcomes by promoting engagement, providing immediate feedback, and facilitating personalised learning experiences. Specific AI tools like Virtual Reality (VR) applications, automated writing feedback systems, and chatbots were analysed for their effectiveness in enhancing speaking, writing, and grammar skills. By conducting a detailed thematic analysis, this study highlighted both the benefits and limitations of AI-driven language education, underscoring AI's role in promoting self-regulated learning while noting areas needing cautious implementation, such as over-reliance on technology and equitable access. IMPACT STATEMENT{\textless}br /{\textgreater} This study will interest anyone keen on understanding how AI is reshaping language education. As AI technologies become integral to personalised learning, this research reviews the impact of tools like chatbots, automated feedback systems, and virtual environments on developing essential language skills such as speaking, writing, grammar, and vocabulary. The paper highlights how AI fosters learner autonomy by providing real-time, tailored feedback that encourages self-regulation, a vital component of modern education. It also explores challenges, including the risk of over-reliance on AI and the disparity in access to advanced technologies. This study offers a balanced view, showing both the potential and limitations of AI in language education. It is especially useful for educators, technologists, and policymakers interested in leveraging AI to create more effective, inclusive, and adaptive learning environments, while maintaining a focus on critical thinking and creativity.},

	abstract = {Altering reafferent sensory information can have a profound effect on motor output. Introducing a short delay [delayed auditory feedback (DAF)] during speech production results in modulations of voice and loudness, and produces a range of speech dysfluencies. The ability of speakers to resist the effects of delayed feedback is variable yet it is unclear what neural processes underlie differences in susceptibility to DAF. Here, susceptibility to DAF is investigated by looking at the neural basis of within and between subject changes in speech fluency under 50 and 200 ms delay conditions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, networks involved in producing speech under two levels of DAF were identified, lying largely within networks active during normal speech production. Independent of condition, fluency ratings were associated with midbrain activity corresponding to periaqueductal grey matter. Across subject variability in ability to produce normal sounding speech under a 200 ms delay was associated with activity in ventral sensorimotor cortices, whereas ability to produce normal sounding speech under a 50ms delay was associated with left inferior frontal gyrus activity. These data indicate whilst overlapping cortical mechanisms are engaged for speaking under different delay conditions, susceptibility to different temporal delays in speech feedback may involve different processes.

Effective AAC training is crucial for enabling individuals to achieve personal goals and enhance social participation. This study aimed to explore potential training strategies for children using P300 based BCI-AAC systems through focus group discussions with experts in AAC and BCI technologies. Participants identified six key themes for effective training: (1) Scaffolding-developing adaptive systems tailored to each child's developmental level, including preteaching, visual display adaptations, and gamification; (2) Verbal Instructions-emphasizing the use of clear, simple language and spoken prompts; (3) Feedback-incorporating immediate feedback and biofeedback methods to reinforce learning; (4) Positioning-ensuring proper trunk stability and addressing electrode placement; (5) Modeling and Physical Supports-using physical cues and demonstrating BCI-AAC use; and (6) Considerations for Visual Impairment-accommodating cortical visual impairment (CVI) with suitable stimuli and environmental adjustments. These insights offer an initial foundation for identifying P300 BCI-AAC training strategies for children. Further systematic research with end users, support networks, and professionals is needed to validate, refine, and expand interventions that support diverse communication needs.},

	abstract = {This field study examined the automatic speech recognition (ASR) of voice-directed computerized systems for order selectors employed in large industrial settings (e.g., fulfillment centers, distribution centers, warehouses, and manufacturing plants). Voice-directed systems for order selection require selectors to listen to instructions via a headset and speak into a microphone, directing each worker to select products for store orders throughout the facility. Originally, ASR used voice recognition that required "voice enrollment" (voice setup) for each worker plus a trainer's time required as part of the setup. Voice setup generally averaged about 60 min for both the worker and the trainer. Lately, a newer technology now utilizes "speech recognition," which eliminates voice enrollment altogether. This study measured order selector voice setup times between voice recognition and speech recognition in five facilities. In two distribution centers where speech recognition was implemented, all voice setup hours for all order selectors (n = 55) plus the trainer's time were eliminated. This amounted to a total savings of 110 h. Moreover, using speech recognition becomes a recurring saving for each new employee entering the organization. Now the focus of training is shifted from voice setup to immediately training workers to select orders via voice, an ergonomic improvement.},

	abstract = {Application of serious games in distance learning can raise quality of education and student satisfaction on a higher level. However, when student learns through game, his focus is moved from learning domain to different context of the game. This actually enables to achieve fun and learn at the same time. But this approach also makes harder for educators to track and analyse students learning progress during game session, which is crucial in order to provide immediate feedback and to help students reach established learning goals. Such a specific learning environment requires concrete real-time analytical tool that will adequately match the dynamic game environment. This paper proposes a new tool for visualisation of student learning model during gameplay session. Tool can be used by educators and by students to track the game progress. Using this tool educators are provided with real-time tracking of students learning and it enables them to react and influence the overall learning process. Evaluation of the proposed approach was done through an empirical study, conducted on educators group monitoring an educational game session, using the combination of traditional analytic tool and the newly proposed visualisation approach. Initial quantitative results and recorded opinions of the participants speak in favour of the proposed approach and justify further investment in development of this specific learning analytics method.

Participants were 61 students who received six tutoring science sessions of approximately 20 min each. Sessions consisted of a sequence of narrated multimedia science presentations during which a virtual tutor explained science phenomena displayed in pictures. Narrated science explanations were followed by one or more multiple choice questions with immediate feedback about students' choices and a possible second attempt, during which students reached 97\% accuracy. A pretest and posttest was administered to assess students' ability to reason about the science and to transfer knowledge to new contexts. Results indicated significantly greater improvement in the understanding of the science concepts taught during the tutoring sessions, relative to the concepts that were not taught. Results from the surveys administered to teachers and students indicated that the program was well received. Detailed analysis of student error responses provided a deeper understanding about the complex interplay between students' prior knowledge, the way topics were taught in the multimedia lessons, and the way learning was assessed. Findings from the quantitative and qualitative analyses are discussed in the context of designing high quality lessons delivered through a virtual tutoring system.},

	abstract = {This article suggests that the application of PeLe (Peer Learning Assessment System) software, a variant of student response technology, provides efficient assessment, a constructive feedback process, a motivating learning environment and increased post-assessment learning for the students. An emphasis is placed on the value of immediate feedback, tailored to the class by a careful monitoring of student contributions through the software's instructor interface. Further, this immediacy requires a rethinking of the instructor's role and methods, including increased didactical flexibility and methodological shrewdness. The results and experiences presented were arrived at through the MobiLL pilot project lead by HiST Sor-Trondelag University College in Norway, whose HiST Mobile software allows for individual student responses from handheld devices and an appropriately progressive methodology to promote learning. The project studied the effects of applying the PeLe software to language assessment and training in a group of 47 test students aged 16 to 40, with a similar control group of 48. Building on the positive experiences with the software's application in science education [Talmo, Einum et. al. 2012], this pilot project aimed at identifying similar effects in language learning. The results showed that on average, test students improved more than control students. Test students, when stratified into groups based on competence, seemed to show a somewhat higher improvement than their respective control counterparts the lower their initial competences were. This seems to indicate that frequent testing is beneficial for lower level students and that the methodology, including immediate feedback, has a further beneficial effect. However, parametric and non-parametric testing proved that no statistical inferences can confidently be made until the statistical sample is increased, and the results therefore have to be seen as indicative pilot project results, prompting further research. Assessing the student's language skills is only half the process. The instant feedback on the students' competences the instructor gets through the software allows him not just to give immediate response, but to do so in a pedagogical way. By providing guidelines for post-processing, where the students can discuss and give a re-vote, collaboratively define key concepts or otherwise engage with their test result, the instructor lets students consolidate or re-evaluate their tested knowledge. During this process, instructors in the test groups observed an increased activity from students on all levels practicing language skills such as speaking, listening, conversation, writing and reading. There is reason to believe that the commitment of the test, the immediacy of the post-test processing and the aspect of remedying their mistakes prompts students of all levels to practice and increase their language skills, and these observations formed the background for the subsequent SkiLL project [ Einum 2015]. Furthermore, a questionnaire at the end of the project showed that the use of a student response assessment tool such as PeLe yielded positive results for the learning process. Two thirds of the students replied that PeLe had a large or very large effect on their participation and motivation in the subject while similar numbers emphasised the importance of immediate feedback from the instructor and a post-processing phase with a possible re-vote for the students. These findings indicate that while the project did not conclusively prove higher improvement in grammar, culture and literature knowledge in the test group, the student response tool appear to have increased participation, motivation and possibly skills learning across the learning levels.},

It explores the interplay between teachers' individual differences - namely educational background, teaching experience, and additional training - and their decisions regarding OCF. EFL teachers in three Turkish universities each had three hours of their speaking classes recorded. A thematic analysis of stimulated recall interview data revealed that teachers' decisions were influenced by learner-related, contextual, and teacher-specific factors. The teachers stated that they provided OCF because they believed that learners expected it. Learner-related factors such as emotions and low proficiency served as deterrents to OCF. Regarding the contextual factors, institutional expectations motivated the provision of OCF, while the nature of activities dissuaded teachers from administering OCF. The teacher factor most commonly cited as a stimulus for providing OCF was the inclination to elicit the correct form from students. The teachers were reluctant to provide OCF because they favoured delayed feedback at the end of the activity or lesson. Regression analysis of the video data revealed that only teaching experience contributed significantly to teachers' decision-making. The role of teaching experience is discussed, and suggestions are made regarding the provision of OCF.},

	abstract = {The goal of this project was to design a scaffolded learning activity that develops English learners' (ELs) argumentation skills. In this study, we investigated how middle school ELs interacted with a game-enhanced scenario-based assessment of argumentation skills (named Seaball). The target skills included identifying and classifying opinions on a controversial issue. Various features, such as language-based accommodations, were embedded in the assessment design to make the tasks more accessible to ELs. Immediate performance feedback was also provided in the assessment. We conducted a pilot study with 163 middle school students (including 96 ELs and 67 native English speakers as a control group) to both examine their performance and evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations. Results indicated that English proficiency levels were significantly related to student performance in Seaball, and that ELs were outperformed by their English-speaking peers. Additionally, while survey data revealed that students considered the language accommodations embedded in the task to be helpful (e.g. the glossary accommodation), the accommodations had no significant impact on Seaball performance. Both ELs and non-ELs generally agreed that they benefited from receiving immediate feedback in the task. The findings suggest that the approach to designing EL accommodations for students engaging in ELA tasks employed in this work may be promising. Further, this approach has potential to guide the design of formative assessments intended to support ELs in learning ELA argumentation skills.},

	abstract = {Acquiring a second language at the university level can be a challenging endeavor, especially for adolescents who may experience apprehension about speaking and practicing in the presence of their peers. To surmount these obstacles, the utilization of the metaverse for language learning emerges as a viable strategy. However, the current landscape of metaverse platforms often reveals a deficiency in the functionalities required for efficient autonomous learning. In response to this predicament, we have developed a metaverse-based game, Questverse, integrated with Spatial.io, to foster an environment conducive to immersive learning activities. This platform not only facilitates interaction between instructors and learners but also introduces an innovative online game focused on stage speech training. Features such as customizable avatars and PolyU virtual coins have been incorporated to enhance student engagement. A distinguished feature of Questverse is the incorporation of a chatbot designed to support self-directed learning. This tool allows learners to hone their language abilities independently, with immediate feedback and performance assessments. Rigorous evaluations involving various student demographics have been undertaken, yielding optimistic outcomes. The findings affirm the platform's efficacy in augmenting language proficiency and bolstering learners' confidence in their language capabilities. A specialized questionnaire, GCTM, has been devised to assess further our course design's impact, which is grounded in constructivist teaching principles and game development. This learner-oriented approach enables us to glean insights from the students' perspectives on their experiences within the metaverse, thus providing a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of our educational strategies.},

	abstract = {The development of active-learning methods is strongly proliferating nowadays in Higher Education studies. Roughly speaking, active learning can be understood as a way of learning in which students are more directly involved in the learning process. It is commonly accepted that, in contrast to traditional methods, substantial improvement of the own learning process is achieved through active methodologies. In particular, teachers must address an extra effort to engage the interest of students when faced with subjects provided with strong theoretical background (such as automatic control related topics). Indeed, one of the main drawbacks reported by the own students is their difficulty to connect real engineering application and theoretical lessons. In this paper, we present an active learning method conceived for automatic control subjects with the aid of virtual laboratories compatible with a wide range of web browsers for this end. In a first stage, some real engineering problems for students in the classroom are raised. Through a suitable follow-up of intermediate results and the appropriate discussions, teachers will be able to obtain an immediate feedback while evaluating the quality of learning at each stage. It is worthwhile mentioning that virtual labs are developed using the standard web interactive programming language HTML and Javascript, which only requires a web browser to be executed. Hence, in comparison to previous academic years, it is expected to better promote the usefulness of the control engineering for the students' careers with high degree of autonomy for self-scheduling homework and low cost resources, while improving the self-motivation and long-term quality of learning.},

	abstract = {Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. MI tends to be underutilized in clinical settings, in part because of limited and ineffective training. To implement MI more widely, there is a critical need to improve the MI training process in a manner that can provide prompt and efficient feedback. Our team has developed and tested a training tool, Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI), that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide immediate MI metrics and thereby address the need for more effective MI training. Methods: Metrics produced by the ReadMI tool from transcripts of 48 interviews conducted by medical residents with a simulated patient were examined to identify relationships between physician-speaking time and other MI metrics, including the number of open- and closed-ended questions. In addition, interrater reliability statistics were conducted to determine the accuracy of the ReadMI's analysis of physician responses. Results: The more time the physician spent talking, the less likely the physician was engaging in MI-consistent interview behaviors (r = -0.403, p = 0.007), including open-ended questions, reflective statements, or use of a change ruler. Conclusion: ReadMI produces specific metrics that a trainer can share with a student, resident, or clinician for immediate feedback. Given the time constraints on targeted skill development in health professions training, ReadMI decreases the need to rely on subjective feedback and/or more time-consuming video review to illustrate important teaching points.},

Emotions such as speaking anxiety and language enjoyment can influence EFL students' achievement. The present study investigated the effects of incorporating an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot into think-pair-share (TPS) activities on foreign language speaking anxiety (FLSA), foreign language enjoyment (FLE), and speaking performance. We used a pretest-posttest control and a quasi-experimental design and conducted experiments over 6 weeks. The participants comprised 75 first-year students selected from a state university in Indonesia during the fall semester of the 2022-2023 academic year; 39 students were assigned to the experimental group, engaging in TPS activities with an AI chatbot, and 36 were assigned to the control group, engaging in conventional TPS activities. Data were collected using an 18-item FLSA questionnaire, a 10-item FLE questionnaire, and a speaking test based on the IELTS speaking evaluation rubric. The results revealed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group. Incorporating the AI chatbot into TPS activities notably reduced the students' FLSA, enhanced their FLE, and improved their speaking performance. Moreover, interviews with five randomly selected students revealed positive perceptions regarding the use of AI chatbot in TPS activities, supporting the quantitative results. Future research should consider longer observation periods and comprehensive evaluations to further investigate the effect of AI chatbots in TPS activities across cognitive and affective domains.},

This study explores the application status of using artificial intelligence chatbots for spoken language learning in China. It also discusses the impact of human likeness and self-efficacy, social presence concerning EFL learners' motivation, and the distribution of learning effects. Moreover, whether artificial intelligence technical proficiency impacts learning motivation. 351 EFL students who had experience acquiring spoken English using an AI chatbot participated in the questionnaire survey of this study. After collecting the survey data, the data analysis was conducted using a structural equation model (SEM). The study found that human likeness, self-efficacy, and social presence strongly predict learning motivation. The human likeness of AI chatbots and their social presence can significantly affect learners' self-efficacy. In AI technology education, learning motivation can still significantly predict learning outcomes. Through the analysis of the moderating effect of PROCESS, this study concluded that when learners have high technical proficiency, the moderating effect of technical proficiency on learning motivation is more significant. Through the actual survey data output and theory construction, this study deeply discusses the factors that influence the interaction process of AI chatbots for language learning and provides both data and theoretical support. Designers can use them to optimize language learning programs for AI chatbots.},

	abstract = {Foreign language anxiety (FLA) has been a perennial concern in language learning, as foreign language (FL) learners often communicate feelings of anxiety, stress, or nervousness. This study explored the role of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in speaking practice for FLA management of 48 undergraduate participants in an EFL class in Egypt. An eight-week, quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design examined learner anxiety levels using a 33-item FLA questionnaire. Their oral proficiency was assessed via roleplaying using an interaction-enhanced public version of the IELTS speaking evaluation rubric. The results confirmed that FL learners experienced FLA pre- and post-intervention. The identified anxiety levels played a facilitative role in FL learning with several ensuing gains. The use of conversationally enhanced AI chatbots in interactive activities slightly intensified learners' FLA, thus meriting further investigation of these objectives. Overall, subject to further development, AI chatbots are promising for significantly improving linguistic output gains; however, this study found that learners' speech-related anxieties were not reduced following the interactions with the chatbots. It is concluded that FLA plays an underexplored facilitative role in sharpening learner cognitive faculties and linguistic capacities. Moreover, AI chatbots may be beneficial in advancing FL learning with significant potential in EFL contexts, facilitating improved interaction and oral communication. These findings support the integration of AI technologies as effective tools in FL education, providing flexible, interactive, and learner-centred learning. This study is expected to be of considerable interest to FL educators and learners.},

	abstract = {Despite the recognised importance of communicative competence in language acquisition, many English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners persistently grapple with affective barriers such as speaking anxiety, shyness, and demotivation, alongside underdeveloped social-emotional competence (SEC), challenges that traditional speaking instruction methods have often struggled to comprehensively address. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-integrated speaking instruction on EFL learners' SEC, demotivation to speak, shyness, and speaking skill development, thereby addressing a crucial gap by evaluating a novel technological intervention. To achieve this, a quasi-experimental design was employed, allocating participants into an experimental group (EG) receiving AI-integrated speaking instruction and a control group (CG) engaging in traditional speaking instruction via the Big Blue Button platform; pre- and post-intervention data were collected using validated questionnaires for SEC, demotivation, shyness, and speaking development, supplemented by an attitude questionnaire for the EG. The results from a one-way MANOVA revealed statistically significant and positive outcomes for the AI-integrated approach, with learners in the EG demonstrating substantial improvements in their SEC and overall speaking skills, alongside a significant reduction in demotivation to speak and shyness when compared to the CG, a finding corroborated by the EG participants' predominantly positive attitudes towards the AI intervention. These findings carry important implications for EFL pedagogy, suggesting that AI-integrated speaking instruction presents a more efficacious strategy for concurrently enhancing learners' speaking proficiency and fostering crucial social-emotional skills, thus providing empirical support for integrating AI tools to create more supportive and effective pathways for EFL students to overcome affective hurdles and improve their communicative abilities.},

To fill this void, the present qualitative study aimed to unveil English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers' perceived AI-induced emotions and associated regulatory strategies used during their L2 speaking and writing instruction. A cohort of 21 Iranian EFL teachers were non-randomly picked up to attend a semi-structured interview and complete a written narrative frame. The results of thematic analysis through MAXQDA software divulged that the participants frequently experienced seven positive emotions including 'excitement', 'confidence', 'joy', 'pride', 'satisfaction', 'passion', and 'engagement'. On the negative side, 'anxiety', 'worry', 'stress', 'apprehension', and 'frustration' were repeatedly induced by AI tools in L2 speaking and writing classes. Moreover, it was found that four 'up-regulating' and five 'down-regulating' strategies, either antecedent-focused or response-focused had been commonly employed by the teachers to manage their positive and negative AI-induced emotions. A discussion of the findings and practical implications for considering teacher emotionality when integrating AI technologies into L2 productive skills is provided.},

This research investigates the impact of social network-based interaction on students' English speaking practice with the assistance of AI speaking apps in China. During the summer vacation, 70 students from different Chinese universities and majors were recruited for the experiment. They were required to practice speaking skills with AI apps for five weeks and were divided into two groups. Participants in the experimental group were encouraged to engage in various interactive activities when practicing speaking with AI apps, while those in the control group were asked to use AI speaking apps without interaction. Data were collected through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews as well as pre-and post-tests. The results indicated that students generally held positive attitudes towards interactive activities when using AI apps to practice their spoken English. The finding also showed that social network-based interaction can effectively improve learners' speaking skills in the AI context. This study contributes to the research on the implementation and promotion of AI speaking apps with social networking and extends the previous studies on network-based interaction to the AI-assisted learning environment. An investigation of interactions based on Chinese social network-based platforms such as WeChat can be further applied to other social networking platforms such as Facebook or WhatsApp in different cultural contexts for AI-assisted speaking practice.},

Unlike English as a Second Language (ESL), EFL typically takes place in the learners' home countries, and the potential of the language is limited by geography. Although learning contexts where English is spoken is important, in most EFL courses at the college level, EFL is taught by acquiring vocabularies, grammar and pragmatic features without contextual immersion. In this study, an immersive English learning environment in a 3D virtual world, OpenSimulator, was developed with two key learning artifacts, chatbot and time machine. A single-factor, independent measures design was used to examines learners' presence under four learning conditions: virtual learning environment without digital learning artifacts (VE), virtual learning environment with chatbot (VEC), virtual learning environment with time machine (VETM) and virtual learning environment with chatbot and time machine (VECTM). Three research questions emerging from the four learning conditions form the backbone of this study: (1) Does chatbot increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (2) Does time machine increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (3) Does the combined use of chatbot and time machine increase presence more than either learning artifact alone? The experimental results indicate that the chatbot and time machine increase the learners' sense of immersion and presence. Best design practices should address how immersion and presence can be integrated into affordances of virtual worlds.},

Nevertheless, the emerging technology-supported role-play tasks employing AI (artificial intelligence) could enhance competencies, enabling students to perform better in role-plays. Therefore, to enhance and support students' performance in role-plays, English speaking skills, and their interaction mindset, we integrated an AI-based speaking learning app in the Generalization, Formulation, Correction, Appreciation (AI-GFCA) learning model. A quasi-experiment was conducted in a university with a total of 45 students. One class was randomly assigned to apply the AI-GFCA learning model as the experimental group, while the other was the control group (AI-C). The findings indicated that the AI-GFCA learning model could significantly enhance students' role-play performance, English speaking skills, and interaction mindset. Furthermore, students produced fewer L2 errors and perceived a better learning experience than the AI-C group. It is noted that with the support of AI learning speaking through role-play tasks, students received sufficient corrective feedback, which encouraged them to establish a positive and motivating learning interaction, thus benefiting their academic performance.},

This study recruited 83 freshmen from China to participate in a 4-week LLM-assisted English oral proficiency learning activity, employing a randomized controlled trial. Participants' oral proficiency, foreign language anxiety, willingness to communicate in English, and self-efficacy were assessed before and after the intervention. The results indicated that the LLM (GPT-4) significantly enhanced their oral proficiency. Furthermore, it significantly increased participants' willingness to communicate orally in English and their self-efficacy, while significantly reducing foreign language anxiety. Semi-structured interview analysis revealed learners' positive attitudes towards using LLM and their willingness to continue using them in the future but also highlighted occasional deviations from topics and feedback delays due to network speed during conversations, which influenced participants' experiences to some extent.},

However, foreign language speaking anxiety (FLSA) remains a significant hurdle for EFL learners. This study investigates the combined impact of AI conversation bots on both enhancing L2 speaking skills and reducing FLSA. A mixed methods approach was employed, utilizing an explanatory sequential design. Participants (n = 60) enrolled as undergraduate college students in an IELTS preparation center were assigned to either an experimental group (utilizing Mondly, an AI-powered language learning platform) or a control group. The experimental group received access to Mondly for six weeks, while the control group engaged in alternative speaking practice activities. Both groups completed pre- and post-tests to assess L2 speaking skills (using the IELTS Speaking test) and L2 speaking anxiety (using a validated 19-item scale). Quantitative data analysis revealed significant improvements in L2 speaking skills and reductions in FLSA within the experimental group compared to the control group. Semi-structured interviews with a subset of the experimental group provided qualitative insights into their experiences. Thematic analysis identified positive perceptions regarding the application's effectiveness in enhancing fluency, pronunciation, grammar, motivation, and confidence. Participants also reported reduced anxiety and a more positive learning experience. Overall, the study suggests that AI conversation bots hold promise as a valuable tool for EFL instruction, promoting L2 speaking proficiency and mitigating FLSA.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing - as can be clearly observed not only from the rising recognition of assistance tools such as Siri (Apple) but also from the newly introduced Google Voiced Translator. Yet, some crucial benchmarks still have to be supplied before it can act as a proxy for a real instructor: imagination, creativity, and spontaneity. Automated assessment containing the use of AI is one of the recent education practices. It accelerates the time for exam grading, eliminates human prejudice, and is as precise as human assessors. However, it has encountered many criticisms in education community, in our case, English as foreign language (EFL) learning community. Therefore, this phenomenological inquiry examined Turkish EFL students' and instructors' conceptions on the Versant English Test (VET), an automated test of spoken and written language functioning by means of an AI software. Using semi-structured interview questions and a focus-group discussion, the study adopted a qualitative research design in order to collect the required data. The findings show that EFL university students developed negative attitudes towards VET and that VET is not a reliable and valid test because same questions were observed to have appeared in the computer-based test. In addition, copying and pasting similar sentences produced better results, which decreased the validity and reliability of the test. Another important finding was that the test was reported to have measured only their memory skills but not their language skills. Besides, the curriculum was totally incongruent with the content of the test, which caused a severe washback in EFL learners.},

Aimed at enhancing writing and speaking skills, the app utilizes drama-making for creative expression and real-world communication. This method is aligned with educational theories that emphasize the importance of authentic, contextualized learning experiences. The AI components, such as video-to-text recognition, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-generated sentences, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) features, are integrated to support and personalize the learning process. The study focuses on Heuristic Evaluation based on Nielsen's principles and gathering expert suggestions for enhancing the app's usability and user experience. Ten UI/UX design experts from two Taiwanese universities participated, providing valuable insights. Data collection was divided into three phases: system introduction, operation, and HCI design analysis. A questionnaire based on Nielsen's ten principles of Heuristic Evaluation was the main data collection tool, supported by SPSS for reliability and descriptive statistics analysis. The findings, underscored by a high Cronbach Alpha score, indicate the app's strong foundation in usability, especially in aesthetics and user support. Recommendations for improvement include enhancing user control, error prevention, and content diversity. The study concludes with the expectation that the app, after incorporating expert feedback, will effectively enhance EFL learners' writing and speaking skills.},

This study aims to fill this research gap by employing a 15-week quasi-experimental design with 43 adult participants, divided into two groups. The experimental group (Group IVIT) utilized instructional videos integrated with an AI-driven tutoring system (iTutor), whereas the control group (Group IV) engaged with instructional videos alone. Comparative analysis demonstrated significant enhancements in listening and speaking proficiencies within Group IVIT, which notably outperformed Group IV in speaking skill development. Additionally, learners in Group IVIT reported more positive perceptions of the opportunities for speaking provided by IVIT and experienced less anxiety related to speaking tasks. These findings emphasize the significant potential of integrating intelligent tutoring systems with traditional learning modalities to accelerate language acquisition in adult EFL learners.},

Consequently, AI and software developers have begun creating numerous AI supported applications for teaching and learning. The paper explains the importance of the impacts of the Microsoft Teams - Reading Progress tool as an artificial intelligence platform for promoting ESL students' loud reading and pronunciation skills. This explorative experimental action research was conducted during the fall semester among Level 4 students (N = 24) at the Preparatory Study Centre (English Language Centre) at the University of Technology and Applied Sciences, Al-Musannah (UTAS-A), Oman. The study was administered in a quasi-experimental design, where the researcher measured the outcome variables (number of correct words, rate of accuracy, number of mispronunciations, omissions, repetition, and self-corrections) before and after the intervention of Reading Progress and compared the pretest and post-test results of the experimental group and the control group to determine the causality factors. Furthermore, a gender wise analysis of the experimental group was performed. The quantitative data analysis revealed an overall improvement in most variables in the post-test, with a statistically significant difference in the number of mispronounced words. The qualitative analysis revealed positive perceptions of the AI-powered Reading Progress tool, noting benefits like increased confidence, gaining new vocabulary, and improved speaking skills. Additionally, participants felt certain challenges, such as pronunciation, distractions, and time constraints, and they suggested improvements regarding diverse texts and more AI use. Moreover, though Gender-wise differences were noted, there were not statistically significant.},

L2 learning, especially when it comes to learning some of the most spoken languages in the world, is increasingly including more and more automated methods to assess linguistics aspects and provide feedback to learners, especially on pronunciation issues. On the one hand, only a few of these systems integrate automatic speech recognition as a helping tool for pronunciation assessment. On the other hand, most of the computer-assisted language pronunciation tools focus on the segmental level of the language, providing feedback on specific phonetic pronunciation, and disregarding the suprasegmental features based on intonation, among others. The current review, based on the PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews, overviews the existing tools for L2 learning, classifying them in terms of the assessment level, (grammatical, lexical, phonetic, and prosodic), and trying the explain why so few tools are nowadays dedicated to evaluate the intonational aspect. Moreover, the review also addresses the existing commercial systems, as well as the existing gap between those tools and the research developed in this area. Finally, the manuscript finishes with a discussion of the main findings and foresees future lines of research.},

	abstract = {Utterances by L2 speakers can be unintelligible due to mispronunciation and improper prosody. In computer-aided language learning systems, textual feedback is often provided using a speech recognition engine. However, an ideal form of feedback for L2 speakers should be so fine-grained that it enables them to detect and diagnose unintelligible parts of L2 speakers' utterances. Inspired by language teachers who correct students' pronunciation through a voice-to-voice process, this pilot study utilizes a unique semi-parallel dataset composed of non-native speakers' (L2) reading aloud, shadowing of native speakers (L1) and their script-shadowing utterances. We explore the technical possibility of replicating the process of an L1 speaker's shadowing L2 speech using Voice Conversion techniques, to create a virtual shadower system. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the VC system in simulating L1's shadowing behavior. The output of the virtual shadower system shows a reasonable similarity to the real L1 shadowing utterances in both linguistic and acoustic aspects1.},

	abstract = {The use of digital technologies in the daily routine of second language (L2) classes became unavoidable when teachers needed to overcome mobility restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In countries where access to technological resources in regular classrooms is still limited, the use of free digital resources for pedagogical purposes is a valuable alternative. This pedagogical paper explores the use of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for L2 pronunciation teaching and learning. Three ASR-based activities drawn from Gottardi (2023) are presented and discussed. The assessment is based on the criteria provided by two frameworks. From the pedagogical perspective, we adopted the communicative pronunciation teaching framework (Celce-Murcia; Brinton; Goodwin, 2010), which proposes five steps to teach pronunciation and design materials, including explicit instruction, perception, and production tasks, with different degrees of teacher guidance and feedback. Considering the use of technology and the design of pedagogical activities, we draw on Chapelle's (2001) six criteria to evaluate educational software and activities. We analyzed each ASR-based pronunciation activity in terms of language learning potential, learner fit, meaning focus, authenticity, positive impact, and practicality. Thus, the objective of this pedagogical paper is to 1) discuss how ASR technology can assist L2 pronunciation practice; 2) provide practical examples of ASR-based pronunciation activities designed to be used by L2 teachers; and 3) examine the pedagogical appropriateness of the proposed activities. Finally, pedagogical implications of using ASR for pronunciation practice are discussed.},

When taken separately, few conclusions can be drawn and little extrapolation is possible from any one isolated investigation. Empirical studies on ASR vary tremendously in size, scope, and research questions posited. However, clear patterns and implications for educators and CALL researchers are beginning to emerge from the data. This research synthesis of 50 studies considers how effective ASR tools are at assessing and ultimately improving L2 pronunciation. Two novel rubrics are proposed to categorize evidence strength for individual studies and to further classify the frequency of claims across multiple studies. Results from this analysis suggest that there are strong empirical arguments in favor of utilizing ASR for pronunciation instruction and evaluation. Specifically, ASR has a demonstrated capacity to accurately identify errors, improve pronunciation, and is strongly associated with a positive student experience.},

	abstract = {The authors address the question whether phonological features can be used effectively in an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for pronunciation training in non-native language (L2) learning. Computer-aided pronunciation training consists of two essential tasks-detecting mispronunciations and providing corrective feedback, usually either on the basis of full words or phonemes. Phonemes, however, can be further disassembled into phonological features, which in turn define groups of phonemes. A phonological feature-based ASR system allows the authors to perform a sub-phonemic analysis at feature level, providing a more effective feedback to reach the acoustic goal and perceptual constancy. Furthermore, phonological features provide a structured way for analysing the types of errors a learner makes, and can readily convey which pronunciations need improvement. This paper presents the authors implementation of such an ASR system using deep neural networks as an acoustic model, and its use for detecting mispronunciations, analysing errors, and rendering corrective feedback. Quantitative as well as qualitative evaluations are carried out for German and Italian learners of English. In addition to achieving high accuracy of mispronunciation detection, the system also provides accurate diagnosis of errors. (C) 2018 Acoustical Society of America.},

To improve the performance we focus on mispronunciations occurred at the segmental and sub-segmental levels. In this study, speech attributes scores are first used to measure the pronunciation quality at a sub-segmental level, such as manner and place of articulation. These speech attribute scores are integrated by neural network classifiers to generate segmental pronunciation scores. Compared with the conventional phone-based GOP (Goodness of Pronunciation) system we implement with our dataset, the proposed framework reduces the equal error rate by 8.78\% relative. Moreover, it attains comparable results to phone-based classifier approach to mispronunciation detection while providing comprehensive feedback, including segmental and sub-segmental diagnostic information, to help L2 learners.},

A review of literature on previous empirical studies was carried out, with quantitative and/or qualitative studies conducted by researchers in the field, investigating teachers' and learners' perceptions and the use of ASR and TTS as a pedagogical tool for pronunciation practice. As a result, it was concluded that a) the presented resources seem to have the potential to enhance pronunciation practice, both in terms of perception and production; b) technology can result in considerable benefits to learners, mainly as a supplement to pronunciation teaching; and c) the use of these digital resources is a way of giving learners the opportunity to focus on their specific difficulties and receive personalized feedback while becoming more autonomous in their learning process.},

	abstract = {Practicing pronunciation through language learning systems incorporating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has been effective in helping improve foreign language pronunciation. One of the ASR affordances is that it can provide immediate, personalized feedback on learners' pronunciation. We investigated the effects of two ASR-based language learning systems, I Love Indonesia (ILI) and NovoLearning (NOVO), on learners' word-level and sentence-level pronunciation. ILI offers global corrective feedback, while NOVO is equipped with corrective feedback on phonetic details. 117 Indonesian high school students participated in a five-week-long experiment; 52 students used ILI and 65 NOVO. Three pronunciation measures were calculated on a pre and post reading test: phonetic edit distances plus accentedness and comprehensibility ratings. Results indicate significant improvements in learners' pronunciation, confirming that both systems are promising learning tools, with NOVO leading to more progress. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of ASR-based global and phonetic feedback on learners' pronunciation quality.},

Besides the obvious benefits that these systems can offer, e.g. flexible and inexpensive learning, user interaction in this context can often be problematic. In this article, the authors introduce a parallel layer of feedback in a CALL application, which can monitor interaction, report errors and provide advice and suggestions to students. This mechanism combines knowledge accumulated from four different inputs in order to decide on appropriate feedback, which can be customized and adapted in terms of phrasing, style and language. The authors report the results from experiments conducted at six lower secondary classrooms in German-speaking Switzerland with and without this mechanism. After analyzing approximately 13,000 spoken interactions it can be reasonably argued that their parallel feedback mechanism in L2 actually does help students during interaction and contributes as a motivation factor.},

	abstract = {The Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition have transformed language learning by providing interactive and real-time feedback, enhancing oral English proficiency. These technologies facilitate personalized and adaptive learning, making pronunciation and fluency improvement more efficient. Traditional methods lack real-time speech assessment and individualized feedback, limiting learners' progress. Existing speech recognition models struggle with diverse accents, variations in speaking styles, and computational efficiency, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. This study utilizes three datasets-including a custom dataset of 882 English teachers, the CMU ARCTIC corpus, and LibriSpeech Clean-to ensure generalizability and robustness. The methodology integrates Hidden Markov Models for speech recognition, NLP-based text analysis, and computer vision-based lip movement detection to create an adaptive multimodal learning system. The novelty of this study lies in its real-time Bayesian feedback mechanism and multimodal integration of audio, visual, and textual data, enabling dynamic and personalized oral instruction. Performance is evaluated using recognition accuracy, processing speed, and statistical significance testing. The continuous HMM model achieves up to 97.5 \% accuracy and significantly outperforms existing models such as MLP-LSTM and GPT-3.5-turbo (p {\textless} 0.05) across all datasets.

Learners' pronunciation was measured in reading aloud and spontaneous conversation tasks before and after the treatment. Participants' satisfaction and perceptions of the ease of use of the software were also assessed at the end of the course. The results revealed a significant difference in the two groups' pronunciation post-tests, suggesting that peer feedback is more effective than individual practice for the correction of pronunciation. The experimental group was more satisfied than the comparison group with the software. However, no differences in accentedness or perception of ease of use were evident.

	abstract = {Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) is a core component of computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT). Most of the existing MDD approaches focus on dealing with categorical errors (viz. one canonical phone is substituted by another one, aside from those mispronunciations caused by deletions or insertions). However, accurate detection and diagnosis of non-categorial or distortion errors (viz. approximating L2 phones with L1 (first-language) phones, or erroneous pronunciations in between) still seems out of reach. In view of this, we propose to conduct MDD with a novel end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-based ASR) approach. In particular, we expand the original L2 phone set with their corresponding anti-phone set, making the E2E-based MDD approach have a better capability to take in both categorical and non-categorial mispronunciations, aiming to provide better mispronunciation detection and diagnosis feedback. Furthermore, a novel transfer-learning paradigm is devised to obtain the initial model estimate of the E2E-based MDD system without resource to any phonological rules. Extensive sets of experimental results on the L2-ARCTIC dataset show that our best system can outperform the existing E2E baseline system and pronunciation scoring based method (GOP) in terms of the F1-score, by 11.05\% and 27.71\%, respectively.},

Underpinned by the sociocultural theory, the present work examined the effects of leveraging ASR technology to support English vocabulary learning in a tertiary flipped setting. A control group and an experimental group of college students participated in a 14-week study. Both groups had their English classes in a flipped fashion, but the experimental group was assigned with ASR-assisted oral tasks for pre-class self-learning. The pre- and post-intervention in-class task performance of both groups was audio-recorded and transcribed for data analysis. The triadic complexity-accuracy-fluency (CAF) framework was adopted to evaluate the participants' vocabulary learning. The between- and within-subjects effects were examined mainly through procedures of MANCOVA and mixed-design repeated measures ANCOVA. Results showed that on all the metrics of lexical complexity and speed fluency, the experimental group outperformed the control group, and had significant growth over time. On the other hand, the control group only improved significantly overtime on the G-index. On lexical accuracy, there was no significant difference between the two groups, and the within-subjects effect was not significant for either group. The findings lent some support to Skehan's Trade-off Hypothesis and discussions were conducted regarding the triarchic CAF framework.},

Yet there still remain challenges due to system delays and dropouts, heavy accents, and general mistranscriptions. Due to the imperfections of automatic speech recognition, there remains conversational difficulties for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals when conversing with hearing individuals. For instance, hearing conversation partners may often not realize that their Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing conversation partner is missing parts of the conversation. This study examines whether providing visual feedback of captioned conversation to hearing conversation partners can enhance conversational accuracy and dynamics. Through a task-based experiment involving 20 hearing participants we measure the impact on visual feedback of captioning on error rates, self-corrections, and subjective workloads. Our findings indicate that when given visual feedback, the average number of errors made by participants was 1.15 less (p = 0.00258) indicating a notable reduction in errors. When visual feedback is provided, the average number of self-corrections increased by 3.15 (p {\textless} 0.001), suggesting a smoother and more streamlined conversation These results show that the inclusion of visual feedback in conversation with a Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing individual can lead to improved conversational efficiency.},

A speech recognition software program, SpeechAce, was embedded within the e-learning course to provide live practice and feedback on pronunciation to 372 undergraduate students at the University of Naples "L'Orientale" in 2016-2017. The project team was composed by Professors of English Oriana Palusci and Katherine E. Russo, who designed and coordinated the project, and e-tutors Jacqueline Aiello and Anna Mongibello, who generated the online course on Moodle and monitored students' activities. The virtual class was created to foster awareness of English sounds and to practice pronunciation, an area that is often neglected in the Italian education system due to the large number of enrolled students. This paper first describes the project in depth and draws on the quantitative analysis of the students' performance in combination with authentic online listening input. Then, data collected in pre- and post-program questionnaires are analyzed to examine the impact of participation in the online project on self-perceived pronunciation proficiency and L2 self-confidence, and to unveil participants' opinions and experiences in this virtual environment.},

Most existing approaches of acoustic modeling in CAPT are based on non-native corpora while there are so many living languages in the world. It is impractical to collect and annotate every non-native speech corpus considering different language pairs. In this work, we address non-native acoustic modeling (both on phonetic and articulatory level) based on transfer learning. In order to effectively train acoustic models of non-native speech without using such data, we propose to exploit two large native speech corpora of learner's native language (L1) and target language (L2) to model cross-lingual phenomena. This kind of transfer learning can provide a better feature representation of non-native speech. Experimental evaluations are carried out for Japanese speakers learning English. We first demonstrate the proposed acoustic-phone model achieves a lower word error rate in non-native speech recognition. It also improves the pronunciation error detection based on goodness of pronunciation (GOP) score. For diagnosis of pronunciation errors, the proposed acoustic-articulatory modeling method is effective for providing detailed feedback at the articulation level.},

"Kannada Kali" is a prototype Android application that leverages learners' increasing access to smartphones to evaluate the pronunciation of Kannada words and provide feedback using a cloud -based framework. A CAPT system typically uses an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) sub-system. For sufficient accuracy, ASR systems need to be trained using speech data from both native (L1) and nonnative (L2) speakers. Since the latter type of data is particularly difficult to gather, we follow recent research efforts that seek to minimize the dependency on large speech corpora. We recorded 21 Kannada words (two to five syllables long) pronounced correctly by a Kannada teacher as templates, and 1169 samples of these words spoken by 19 native and non-native Kannada speakers aged 18 to 25 years. These samples were manually rated on a 5-point Likert scale by the Kannada teacher and used to train a neural network classifier for our application. "Kannada Kali" provides learners feedback that matches the teacher ratings with an accuracy of 86\% on binary classification and 68\% on multi-class classification. We also propose a novel approach for detecting mispronunciations using Self Organizing Maps (SOM) and report promising initial results.},

We investigated 38 recordings of two paragraphs from Conrad's Typhoon. The whisper transcriptions were compared to the original text that was read by these second-year French undergraduates. We used WER (Word Error Rate) and Levenshtein distance to assess the various graphic representations of Conrad's reference text. We show how the differences can be transformed into operationalised feedback for learners. We used expert phonetic knowledge to check the plausibility of the phonetic interpretation with the signal (in particular the recall of H dropping produced by French learners). Our findings suggest that the transcriptions produced by the medium model converge with what a native speaker understands and that the tiny model produces alternate transcriptions that are plausible candidates for learner errors.},

Therefore, the demand for a second language is constantly expanding, accelerating the development of the field of English oral evaluation and also accelerating the development of online education. The study proposes a text priori based oral evaluation model, which is based on the Transformer model and uses target phonemes as input to the Decoder. The model successfully predicts the relationship between actual pronunciation and error labels. At the same time, a self-supervised oral evaluation model with accent is constructed, which simulates the training process of misreading data by calculating semantic distance. The experimental results show that when the training set ratio reaches its maximum in the Speed Ocean dataset and the L2 Arctic dataset, the F1 values of the proposed method are 0.612 and 0.596, respectively; the length of the target phoneme has a smaller impact on this model compared to other models. Experiments have shown that the proposed deep learning method can alleviate deployment difficulties, directly optimize the effectiveness of oral evaluation, provide more accurate feedback, and also provide users with a better learning experience. This has practical significance for the development of the field of oral evaluation.},

All speakers involved use a specific English-based phraseology and a significant number of pilots and controllers are non-native English speakers. The aim of this work is to enhance pilot-ATC communications by adding a Speech to Text (STT) capability that will transcribe ATC speech into text on the cockpit interfaces to help the pilot understand ATC speech in a more optimal manner (be able to verify what he/she heard on the radio by looking at the text transcription, be able to decipher non-native English accents from controllers, not lose time asking the ATC to repeat the message several times). In this paper, we first describe an accent analysis study which was carried out both on a theoretical level but also with the help of feedback from several hundred airline pilots. Then, we present the dataset that was set up for this work.

	abstract = {Verbal communication - and pronunciation as its part - is a core skill that can be developed through guided learning. An artificial intelligence system can take a role in these guided learning approaches as an enabler of an application for pronunciation learning with a recommender system to guide language learners through exercises and feedback system to correct their pronunciation. In this paper, we report on a user study on language learners' perceived usefulness of the application. 16 international students who spoke non-native English and lived in Australia participated. 13 of them said they need to improve their pronunciation skills in English because of their foreign accent. The feedback system with features for pronunciation scoring, speech replay, and giving a pronunciation example was deemed essential by most of the respondents. In contrast, a clear dichotomy between the recommender system perceived as useful or useless existed; the system had features to prompt new common words or old poorly-scored words. These results can be used to target research and development from information retrieval and reinforcement learning for better and better recommendations to speech recognition and speech analytics for accent acquisition.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an innovative mobile-assisted language-learning (MALL) system that harnesses deep learning technology to analyze pronunciation patterns and deliver real-time, personalized feedback. Drawing inspiration from how the human brain processes speech through neural pathways, our system analyzes multiple speech features using spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and formant frequencies in a manner that mirrors the auditory cortex's interpretation of sound. The core of our approach utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify pronunciation patterns from user-recorded speech. To enhance the assessment accuracy and provide nuanced feedback, we integrated a fuzzy inference system (FIS) that helps learners identify and correct specific pronunciation errors. The experimental results demonstrate that our multi-feature model achieved 82.41\% to 90.52\% accuracies in accent classification across diverse linguistic contexts. The user testing revealed statistically significant improvements in pronunciation skills, where learners showed a 5-20\% enhancement in accuracy after using the system. The proposed MALL system offers a portable, accessible solution for language learners while establishing a foundation for future research in multilingual functionality and mobile platform optimization. By combining advanced speech analysis with intuitive feedback mechanisms, this system addresses a critical challenge in language acquisition and promotes more effective self-directed learning.},

Grounded in Second Language Acquisition theories-including interactionist theory and sociocultural theory-Google Read Along offers various pedagogical features that support oral language development. Despite its potential, research on the app's effectiveness remains underexplored. Addressing the growing global emphasis on improving English education for children, particularly in non-English-speaking countries, this study evaluates the app's impact on young EFL learners' oral skills, including sentence reading, question answering, picture description, storytelling, and overall speaking performance. Thirty-five elementary school EFL learners participated in a six-week intervention, with 18 in the experimental group using Google Read Along and 17 in the control group using picture books. Each group completed ten 10-15-minute sessions. Results from a linear mixed-effects model reveal that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in overall speaking performance. While the app did not yield significant improvements in sentence reading compared to conventional methods, its effects were more pronounced in learners' ability to describe pictures and, notably, in answering questions and storytelling, where greater improvement trends were observed. These findings underscore the value of ASR-based reading tutors like Google Read Along in promoting oral skills and communicative competence among young language learners.},

Computer based visual feedback, visual presentation of speech on screen has shown to be an effective supplement of incomplete or distorted auditory feedback in the case of children with grave hearing-impairment. In this paper, we introduce a novel prosody teaching system where intensity (accent), intonation and rhythm are presented visually for the students (in both separate and combined display mode) as visual feedback and automatic assessment scores are given jointly and separately for the goodness of intonation and rhythm. Evaluation of the automatic assessment was done with cooperation of experts in the field of treatment of hard of hearing children. The results showed that the automatic assessment scores correspond to the subjective evaluations given by the teachers. The evaluation of the whole system was done in a school for hard of hearing children, by comparing the development of a group of students using our prosody teaching system with the development of a control group. The speaking ability of students were compared by a subjective listening experiment after a 3 months teaching course. The students who used the computer based prosody teaching software could produce nicer prosody than the students in the control group. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) manages to quantify second language (L2) learners' pronunciation proficiency in a target language by providing fine-grained feedback with multiple aspect scores (e.g., accuracy, fluency, and completeness) at various linguistic levels (i.e., phone, word, and utterance). Most of the existing efforts commonly follow a parallel modeling framework, which takes a sequence of phone-level pronunciation feature embeddings of a learner's utterance as input and then predicts multiple aspect scores across various linguistic levels. However, these approaches neither take the hierarchy of linguistic units into account nor consider the relatedness among the pronunciation aspects in an explicit manner. In light of this, we put forward an effective modeling approach for APA, termed HierGAT, which is grounded on a hierarchical graph attention network. Our approach facilitates hierarchical modeling of the input utterance as a heterogeneous graph that contains linguistic nodes at various levels of granularity. On top of the tactfully designed hierarchical graph message passing mechanism, intricate interdependencies within and across different linguistic levels are encapsulated and the language hierarchy of an utterance is factored in as well. Furthermore, we also design a novel aspect attention module to encode relatedness among aspects. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multiple types of linguistic nodes into graph-based neural networks for APA and perform a comprehensive qualitative analysis to investigate their merits. A series of experiments conducted on the speechocean762 benchmark dataset suggests the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach in relation to several competitive baselines.},

	abstract = {Speech-induced suppression is the normal, relative amplitude reduction of the auditory evoked potential for self-, compared to externally-generated, auditory stimulation. It remains controversial as to whether adults who stutter exhibit expected auditory modulation during speech; some studies have reported a significant difference between stuttering and fluent groups in speech-induced suppression during speech movement planning, while others have not. We compared auditory evoked potentials (N1 component) for auditory feedback arising from one's own voice (Speaking condition) with passive listening to a recording of one's own voice (Listening condition) in 24 normally-fluent speakers and 16 adults who stutter under various delayed auditory feedback (DAF) time conditions (100 ms, 200 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000 ms). We presented the participant's own voice with a delay, immediately after presenting it without a delay. Our working hypothesis was that the shorter the delay time, the more likely the delayed sound is perceived as self-generated. Therefore, shorter delay time conditions are proposed to result in relatively enhanced suppression of the auditory system. Results showed that in fluent speakers, the shorter the delay time, the more the auditory evoked potential in the Speaking condition tended to be suppressed. In the Listening condition, there was a larger evoked potential with shorter delay times. As a result, speech-induced suppression was only significant at the short delay time conditions of 100 and 200 ms. Adults who stutter did not show the opposing changes in the Speaking and Listening conditions seen in the fluent group. Although the evoked potential in the Listening condition tended to decrease as the delay time increased, that in the Speaking condition did not show a distinct trend, and there was a significant suppression only at 200 ms delay. For the 200 ms delay condition, speakers with more severe stuttering showed significantly greater speech-induced suppression than those with less severe stuttering. This preliminary study suggests our methods for investigating evoked potentials by presenting own voice with a delay may provide a clue as to the nature of auditory modulation in stuttering.},

Teaching materials focused on argumentation, and were embedded with the target vocabulary to facilitate incidental mispronunciation. When the intervention group produced target words with misplaced primary stress, they received a recast. The control group did not receive corrective feedback. The results of linear mixed-effects analyses showed that recasts facilitated primary stress development through increased vowel duration. Stimulated recall data confirmed that participants noticed the recasts they received. However, there were no changes in participants' perceptions of stress placement.

	abstract = {Purpose: We review and interpret our recent series of studies investigating motor-to-auditory influences during speech movement planning in fluent speakers and speakers who stutter. In those studies, we recorded auditory evoked potentials in response to probe tones presented immediately prior to speaking or at the equivalent time in no-speaking control conditions. As a measure of pre-speech auditory modulation (PSAM), we calculated changes in auditory evoked potential amplitude in the speaking conditions relative to the no-speaking conditions. Whereas adults who do not stutter consistently showed PSAM, this phenomenon was greatly reduced or absent in adults who stutter. The same between-group difference was observed in conditions where participants expected to hear their prerecorded speech played back without actively producing it, suggesting that the speakers who stutter use inefficient forward modeling processes rather than inefficient motor command generation processes. Compared with fluent participants, adults who stutter showed both less PSAM and less auditory-motor adaptation when producing speech while exposed to formant-shifted auditory feedback. Across individual participants, however, PSAM and auditory-motor adaptation did not correlate in the typically fluent group, and they were negatively correlated in the stuttering group. Interestingly, speaking with a consistent 100-ms delay added to the auditory feedback signal-normalized PSAM in speakers who stutter, and there no longer was a between-group difference in this condition. Conclusions: Combining our own data with human and animal neurophysiological evidence from other laboratories, we interpret the overall findings as suggesting that (a) speech movement planning modulates auditory processing in a manner that may optimize its tuning characteristics for monitoring feedback during speech production and, (b) in conditions with typical auditory feedback, adults who stutter do not appropriately modulate the auditory system prior to speech onset. Lack of modulation of speakers who stutter may lead to maladaptive feedback-driven movement corrections that manifest themselves as repetitive movements or postural fixations.},

We investigated for AWS and adults who do not stutter (AWNS) (a) a potential relationship between pre-speech auditory modulation and auditory feedback contributions to speech motor learning and (b) the effect on pre-speech auditory modulation of real-time versus delayed auditory feedback. Experiment I used a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm to estimate auditory-motor speech learning. Using acoustic speech recordings, we quantified subjects' formant frequency adjustments across trials when continually exposed to formant-shifted auditory feedback. In Experiment II, we used electroencephalography to determine the same subjects' extent of pre-speech auditory modulation (reductions in auditory evoked potential N1 amplitude) when probe tones were delivered prior to speaking versus not speaking. To manipulate subjects' ability to monitor real-time feedback, we included speaking conditions with non-altered auditory feedback (NAF) and delayed auditory feedback (DAP). Experiment I showed that auditory-motor learning was limited for AWS versus AWNS, and the extent of learning was negatively correlated with stuttering frequency. Experiment II yielded several key findings: (a) our prior finding of limited pre-speech auditory modulation in AWS was replicated; (b) DAF caused a decrease in auditory modulation for most AWNS but an increase for most AWS; and (c) for AWS, the amount of auditory modulation when speaking with DAF was positively correlated with stuttering frequency. Lastly, AWNS showed no correlation between pre-speech auditory modulation (Experiment II) and extent of auditory-motor learning (Experiment I) whereas AWS showed a negative correlation between these measures. Thus, findings suggest that AWS show deficits in both pre-speech auditory modulation and auditory-motor learning; however, limited pre-speech modulation is not directly related to limited auditory-motor adaptation; and in AWS, DAF paradoxically tends to normalize their otherwise limited pre-speech auditory modulation.

	abstract = {Developmental stuttering is a speech disorder that affects about one percent of the adult population worldwide. The cause is still unknown, but not a few researchers have suspected poor auditory-motor integration to be a causal factor. Almost all people who stutter are more or totally fluent in certain conditions, for instance, when speaking in chorus or alone to themselves, in time with the clicking of a metronome, or with delayed or frequency-altered auditory feedback. Understanding why stuttering disappears in these specific conditions could help understand why it occurs in normal speaking conditions. Here, the first unified account for the effect is proposed, based on evidence that receptive speech processing depends on attention to the speech signal. It is proposed that fluency-enhancing conditions re-allocate the speaker's attention, that is, the perceptual and processing capacities, by drawing attention to the auditory feedback of speech. This improves auditory-motor integration, which reduces stuttering. The hypothesis is discussed for all well-known fluency-enhancing conditions, and consequences for therapy are outlined.},

Two experiments were conducted to assess the fluency of AWS under long-latency DAF and to test the effect of short-latency DAF on speech kinematic variability in AWS. Method: In Experiment 1, 15 AWS performed a conversational speaking task under nonaltered auditory feedback and 250-ms DAF. The rates of stuttering-like disfluencies, other disfluencies, and speech errors and articulation rate were compared. In Experiment 2, 13 AWS and 15 adults who do not stutter (AWNS) read three utterances under four auditory feedback conditions: nonaltered auditory feedback, amplified auditory feedback, 25-ms DAF, and 50-ms DAF. Across-utterance kinematic variability (spatiotemporal index) and within-utterance variability (percent determinism and stability) were compared between groups. Results: In Experiment 1, under 250-ms DAF, the rate of stuttering-like disfluencies and speech errors increased significantly, while articulation rate decreased significantly in AWS. In Experiment 2, AWS exhibited higher kinematic variability than AWNS across the feedback conditions. Under 25-ms DAF, the spatiotemporal index of AWS decreased significantly compared to the other feedback conditions. AWS showed lower overall percent determinism than AWNS, but their percent determinism increased under 50-ms DAF to approximate that of AWNS. Conclusions: Auditory feedback manipulations can alter speech fluency and kinematic variability in AWS. Longer latency auditory feedback delays induce speech disruptions, while subtle auditory feedback manipulations potentially benefit speech motor control. Both AWS and AWNS are susceptible to auditory feedback during speech production, but AWS appear to exhibit a distinct continuum of sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Adults who stutter speak more fluently during choral speech contexts than they do during solo speech contexts. The underlying mechanisms for this effect remain unclear, however. In this study, we examined the extent to which the choral speech effect depended on presentation of intact temporal speech cues. We also examined whether speakers who stutter followed choral signals more closely than typical speakers did. Method: 8 adults who stuttered and 8 adults who did not stutter read 60 sentences aloud during a solo speaking condition and three choral speaking conditions (240 total sentences), two of which featured either temporally altered or indeterminate word duration patterns. Effects of these manipulations on speech fluency, rate, and temporal entrainment with the choral speech signal were assessed. Results: Adults who stutter spoke more fluently in all choral speaking conditions than they did when speaking solo. They also spoke slower and exhibited closer temporal entrainment with the choral signal during the mid- to late-stages of sentence production than the adults who did not stutter. Both groups entrained more closely with unaltered choral signals than they did with altered choral signals. Conclusions: Findings suggest that adults who stutter make greater use of speech-related information in choral signals when talking than adults with typical fluency do. The presence of fluency facilitation during temporally altered choral speech and conversation babble, however, suggests that temporal/gestural cueing alone cannot account for fluency facilitation in speakers who stutter. Other potential fluency enhancing mechanisms are discussed. Educational Objectives: The reader will be able to (a) summarize competing views on stuttering as a speech timing disorder, (b) describe the extent to which adults who stutter depend on an accurate rendering of temporal information in order to benefit from choral speech, and (c) discuss possible explanations for fluency facilitation in the presence of inaccurate or indeterminate temporal cues.

This article addresses this question by reporting the results of a classroom-based experimental study conducted with 32 young adult Korean learners of English. An instruction-only group and an instruction + CF group were exposed to five 1-hr form-focused lessons that drew learners' attention to the nonnative phonemic contrast /i/-/?/, but only the instruction + CF group was given relevant feedback. Forced-choice identification tasks were completed by participants in a pretest, an immediate posttest, and a delayed posttest. The two groups showed similar accuracy on the pretest; however, the instruction + CF group outperformed the instruction-only group on the immediate and delayed posttests as well as on unfamiliar words. The significant predictors for these differences turned out to be perceptual accuracy vis-a-vis /?/-natural and /?/-synthesized sounds. These findings are discussed in terms of the pivotal role played by CF in developing accuracy in L2 speech perception.},

On random trials, an auditory feedback formant perturbation was applied, and formant responses were compared between groups and pacing conditions.Results: During normally paced speech, ANS showed a significant compensatory response to the perturbation by the end of the perturbed vowel, while AWS did not. In the metronome-paced condition, which significantly reduced the disfluency rate, the opposite was true: AWS showed a significant response by the end of the vowel, while ANS did not.Conclusion: These findings indicate a potential link between the reduction in stuttering found during metronome-paced speech and changes in auditory motor integration in AWS.},

We hypothesized that adults with AOS would increase speech fluency when speaking with noise. Altered auditory feedback (AAF; i.e., delayed/frequency-shifted feedback) was included as a control condition not expected to improve speech fluency. Method: Ten participants with APH/AOS and 10 neurologically healthy (NH) participants were studied under both feedback conditions. To allow examination of individual responses, we used an ABACA design. Effects were examined on syllable rate, disfluency duration, and vocal intensity. Results: Seven of 10 APH/AOS participants increased fluency with masking by increasing rate, decreasing disfluency duration, or both. In contrast, none of the NH participants increased speaking rate with MAF. In the AAF condition, only 1 APH/AOS participant increased fluency. Four APH/AOS participants and 8 NH participants slowed their rate with AAF. Conclusions: Speaking with MAF appears to increase fluency in a subset of individuals with APH/AOS, indicating that overreliance on auditory feedback monitoring may contribute to their disorder presentation. The distinction between responders and nonresponders was not linked to AOS diagnosis, so additional work is needed to develop hypotheses for candidacy and underlying control mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine whether changes in sensorimotor control resulting from speaking conditions that induce fluency in people who stutter (PWS) can be measured using electroencephalographic (EEG) mu rhythms in neurotypical speakers. Methods: Non-stuttering (NS) adults spoke in one control condition (solo speaking) and four experimental conditions (choral speech, delayed auditory feedback (DAF), prolonged speech and pseudostuttering). Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify sensorimotor mu components from EEG recordings. Time-frequency analyses measured mu-alpha (8-13 Hz) and mu-beta (15-25 Hz) event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) during each speech condition. Results: 19/24 participants contributed mu components. Relative to the control condition, the choral and DAF conditions elicited increases in mu-alpha ERD in the right hemisphere. In the pseudostuttering condition, increases in mu-beta ERD were observed in the left hemisphere. No differences were present between the prolonged speech and control conditions. Conclusions: Differences observed in the experimental conditions are thought to reflect sensorimotor control changes. Increases in right hemisphere mu-alpha ERD likely reflect increased reliance on auditory information, including auditory feedback, during the choral and DAF conditions. In the left hemisphere, increases in mu-beta ERD during pseudostuttering may have resulted from the different movement characteristics of this task compared with the solo speaking task. Relationships to findings in stuttering are discussed. Significance: Changes in sensorimotor control related feedforward and feedback control in fluency-enhancing speech manipulations can be measured using time-frequency decompositions of EEG mu rhythms in neurotypical speakers. This quiet, non-invasive, and temporally sensitive technique may be applied to learn more about normal sensorimotor control and fluency enhancement in PWS.},

	abstract = {Stuttering is a fluency disorder, partially alleviated during altered auditory feedback, suggesting abnormal sensorimotor integration in adults who stutter (AWS). As weighting of multiple integrating-information sources would be decided based on their reliabilities, the use of external (auditory feedback) and internal information (prediction of sensory consequences) could correlate with speech processing. We hypothesized that abnormal auditory-feedback processing in AWS could be related to decrease in internal processing precision. We used a perceptual-adaptation experiment of delayed auditory feedback (DAF) to verify the hypothesis. Seventeen AWS and 17 adults who do not stutter (ANS) were required to say "ah" and judge the simultaneity between their motor sensations and vocal sounds in each stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, or 150 ms) after inducing adaptation of DAF (three conditions with 0-, 66-, or 133-ms delay). While no adaptation occurred during the 0 ms condition, perceptual change in simultaneity judgment (adaptation effect) occurred during the 66 and 133 ms conditions. The simultaneity judgments following exposure in each SOA were fitted to the psychometric function in each condition for the AWS and ANS groups. We calculated the mu (signifying the point of subjective simultaneity and adaptation-effect degree) and sigma (signifying the detecting precision) of each function and analyzed them by parametric analyses. For the mu, participant groups and adaptation conditions showed a significant interaction; the adaptation effect was greater in the AWS than in the ANS group. Additionally, the mu and sigma were only positively correlated in the AWS group. The point of subjective simultaneity for auditory delay by inducing DAF was higher in AWS than in ANS, indicating that perception of simultaneity in AWS was influenced by DAF to a greater extent. Moreover, the significant positive correlation between the mu and sigma in AWS showed that the more imprecise the internal auditory processing, the more AWS relied on auditory feedback. It is suggested that the reliability of internal information differed within the AWS group, and AWS with reduced internal reliability appeared to compensate by relying to a great extent on auditory feedback information.},

It remains unknown, however, which specific mechanisms of speech planning and execution are affected by these neurological abnormalities. To investigate pre-movement sensory modulation, we recorded 12 stuttering and 12 nonstuttering adults' auditory evoked potentials in response to probe tones presented prior to speech onset in a delayed-response speaking condition vs. no-speaking control conditions (silent reading; seeing nonlinguistic symbols). Findings indicate that, during speech movement planning, the nonstuttering group showed a statistically significant modulation of auditory processing (reduced N1 amplitude) that was not observed in the stuttering group. Thus, the obtained results provide electrophysiological evidence in support of the hypothesis that stuttering is associated with deficiencies in modulating the cortical auditory system during speech movement planning. This specific sensorimotor integration deficiency may contribute to inefficient feedback monitoring and, consequently, speech dysfluencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Effects of auditory feedback's absence on hearing-impaired individuals are widely documented, but auditory perturbation has not been investigated. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of delayed auditory feedback (DAF) and frequency altered feedback (FAF) on speech production among prelingual cochlear implant (CI) users and normal hearing (NH) individuals, to evaluate CI users' reliance on auditory feedback. Twenty young adults (10 CI, 10 NH), without developmental and cognitive impairments, participated in the study. Under variable auditory feedback conditions, speech production (spontaneous or reading aloud) was measured using speech rate, percentage of interruptions, fundamental frequency (F0), and relative intensity. Results showed that (1) both DAF and FAF caused slower speech rates and more interruptions while reading aloud, with DAF having larger effect; (2) altered feedback produced no differences between groups, except an increase in F0 for CI users during DAF; and (3) CI users' ability to understand speech via phone and without lip-reading was positively correlated with performance under DAF. These findings suggest that auditory perturbation similarly affects speech production among prelingual CI users and NH individuals, indicating CI users depend on auditory feedback to the same degree as normal hearing individuals.},

	abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying stuttering remain poorly understood. A large body of work has focused on sensorimotor integration difficulties in individuals who stutter, including recently the capacity for sensorimotor learning. Typically, sensorimotor learning is assessed with adaptation paradigms in which one or more sensory feedback modalities are experimentally perturbed in real time. Our own previous work on speech with perturbed auditory feedback revealed substantial auditory-motor learning limitations in both children and adults who stutter (AWS). It remains unknown, however, which subprocesses of sensorimotor learning are impaired. Indeed, new insights from research on upper limb motor control indicate that sensorimotor learning involves at least two distinct components: (a) an explicit component that includes intentional strategy use and presumably is driven by target error and (b) an implicit component that updates an internal model without awareness of the learner and presumably is driven by sensory prediction error. Here, we attempted to dissociate these components for speech auditory-motor learning in AWS versus adults who do not stutter (AWNS). Our formant-shift auditory-motor adaptation results replicated previous findings that such sensorimotor learning is limited in AWS. Novel findings are that neither control nor stuttering participants reported any awareness of changing their productions in response to the auditory perturbation and that neither group showed systematic drift in auditory target judgments made throughout the adaptation task. These results indicate that speech auditory-motor adaptation to formant-shifted feedback relies exclusively on implicit learning processes. Thus, limited adaptation in AWS reflects poor implicit sensorimotor learning. Speech auditory-motor adaptation to formant-shifted feedback lacks an explicit component: Reduced adaptation in adults who stutter reflects limitations in implicit sensorimotor learning.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A longstanding finding in persons who stutter is that stuttering frequency significantly reduces during choral reading when compared to the solo reading condition. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this decrease in stuttering frequency may be because speech of the normal speaker dictates the speech rhythm of a person who stutters. We used an automated, sensitive acoustic technique-Envelope Modulation Spectral (EMS) analysis-that allowed us to document speech rhythm. Method: Seventeen adults who stutter (AWS) read sentences under two conditions: solo reading and choral reading. Percentage of syllables stuttered (\%SS), the rate of speech, and speech rhythm were calculated from the recorded sentences from AWS. Further, AWS speech rhythm during solo reading was compared with typical adults. EMS was extracted for the full signal and seven-octave bands. From the extracted envelope six predictor variables (peak frequency, peak amplitude, energy in the spectrum 3-6 Hz, energy in the spectrum from 0 to 4 Hz, energy in the spectrum from 4 to 10 Hz, and the ratio of energy below4 Hz/above 4 Hz) were computed. Results: Significant decrease in stuttering frequency and rate of speech was noticed in choral reading when compared to the solo reading condition. Further, analysis of EMS results suggested the statistically significant difference between two reading conditions (for peak frequency and peak amplitude), and between two groups for all predictor variables. Conclusion: Overall, current results highlight that decreases in stuttering during the choral reading is characterized by a decrease in rate and changes in some aspects of speech rhythm in Kannada speaking AWS.},

	abstract = {Prior findings indicate that individuals who stutter do not show the typical modulation of auditory processing that is observed during speech movement planning in nonstuttering speakers. We now ask whether this lack of planning-related sensory modulation in stuttering adults is specific to the auditory domain. In this first somatosensory study (15 stuttering and 15 nonstuttering participants), we implemented the prior stimulation timeline in a paradigm with orofacial skin stretch stimuli. A robotic device applied skin stretches to elicit somatosensory evoked potentials during speech movement planning and a silent reading control condition. We compared the N1 component for Speaking and No-Speaking to assess a possible influence of movement planning on somatosensory processing. Both groups showed clear N1 responses, consistent with prior validation of the skin stretch stimulation. However, for the selected timepoint of stimulation (i.e., identical to our auditory stimulation studies) we found no evidence of pre-speech somatosensory modulation in either group. There were no amplitude or latency differences between speaking and control conditions and no between-group differences. Given that even typical participants showed no modulation at the probed times during movement planning, whereas some studies have obtained evidence supporting somatosensory modulation for orofacial movements during speech movement execution, (a) the time course of modulation may differ from that observed for auditory stimuli, or (b) input from the specific facial mechanoreceptors stimulated here may be not subject to pre-speech modulation. Future studies should probe somatosensation at different timepoints before and after speech movement onset and in effectors actively performing the articulatory gestures (lip, tongue).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) interferes with speech output. DAF causes distorted and disfluent productions and errors in the serial order of produced sounds. Although DAF has been studied extensively, the specific patterns of elicited speech errors are somewhat obscured by relatively small speech samples, differences across studies, and uncontrolled variables. The goal of this study was to characterize the types of serial order errors that increase under DAF in a systematic syllable sequence production task, which used a closed set of sounds and controlled for speech rate. Method: Sixteen adult speakers repeatedly produced CVCVCV (C = consonant, V = vowel) sequences, paced to a "visual metronome," while hearing self generated feedback with delays of 0-250 ms. Listeners transcribed recordings, and speech errors were classified based on the literature surrounding naturally occurring slips of the tongue. A series of mixed-effects models were used to assess the effects of delay for different error types, for error arrival time, and for speaking rate. Results: DAF had a significant effect on the overall error rate for delays of 100 ms or greater. Statistical models revealed significant effects (relative to zero delay) for vowel and syllable repetitions, vowel exchanges, vowel omissions, onset disfluencies, and distortions. Serial order errors were especially dominated by vowel and syllable repetitions. Errors occurred earlier on average within a trial for longer feedback delays. Although longer delays caused slower speech, this effect was mediated by the run number (time in the experiment) and small compared with those in previous studies. Conclusions: DAF drives a specific pattern of serial order errors. The dominant pattern of vowel and syllable repetition errors suggests possible mechanisms whereby DAF drives changes to the activity in speech planning representations, yielding errors. These mechanisms are outlined with reference to the GODIVA (Gradient Order Directions Into Velocities of Articulators) model of speech planning and production.

	abstract = {Previously, we showed that the N100 amplitude in long latency auditory evoked potentials (LLAEPs) elicited by pure tone probe stimuli is modulated when the stimuli are delivered during speech movement planning as compared with no-speaking control conditions. Given that we probed the auditory system only with pure tones, it remained unknown whether the nature and magnitude of this pre-speech auditory modulation depends on the type of auditory stimulus. Thus, here, we asked whether the effect of speech movement planning on auditory processing varies depending on the type of auditory stimulus. In an experiment with nine adult subjects, we recorded LLAEPs that were elicited by either pure tones or speech syllables when these stimuli were presented prior to speech onset in a delayed-response speaking condition vs. a silent reading control condition. Results showed no statistically significant difference in pre speech modulation of the N100 amplitude (early stages of auditory processing) for the speech stimuli as compared with the nonspeech stimuli. However, the amplitude of the P200 component (later stages of auditory processing) showed a statistically significant pre-speech modulation that was specific to the speech stimuli only. Hence, the overall results from this study indicate that, immediately prior to speech onset, modulation of the auditory system has a general effect on early processing stages but a speech-specific effect on later processing stages. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that pre-speech auditory modulation may play a role in priming the auditory system for its role in monitoring auditory feedback during speech production.},

Electronic patient-reported outcome measures (e-PROMs) monitoring with feedback to clinicians may be an acceptable intervention to improve health-related QOL for patients receiving hemodialysis. This study explored patient and clinician perspectives on e-PROMs monitoring with feedback to clinicians. Study Design: Qualitative study. Setting \& Participants: 41 participants (12 patients, 13 nephrologists, 16 dialysis nurses) who participated in a 6-month feasibility pilot study of adults receiving facility-based hemodialysis across 4 Australian units. The intervention consisted of electronic symptom monitoring with feedback to clinicians, who also received evidence-based symptom management recommendations to improve health-related QOL. Analytical Approach: Semistructured interviews and focus group discussions explored the feasibility and acceptability of e-PROMs monitoring with feedback to clinicians. We conducted a thematic analysis of transcripts. Results: We identified 4 themes: enabling efficient, systematic, and multidisciplinary patient-centered care; experiencing limited data and options for symptom management; requiring familiarity with technology and processes; and identifying barriers and competing priorities. While insufficient patient engagement, logistic/technical challenges, and delayed symptom feedback emerged as barriers to implementation, active engagement by nurses in encouraging and supporting patients during survey completion and clinicians' prompt action after symptom feedback were considered to be facilitators to implementation. Limitations: Limited generalizability due to inclusion of English-speaking participants only. Conclusions: Patients, nurses, and nephrologists considered e-PROMs monitoring with feedback to clinicians feasible for symptom management in hemodialysis. Clinician engagement, patient support, reliable technology, timely symptom feedback, and interventions to address symptom burden are likely to improve its implementation within research and clinical settings.},

The present article assesses the theoretical coherence of the PM with speech processing deficits in CAS. Method: PM and other scores were obtained for 264 participants in 6 groups: CAS in idiopathic, neurogenetic, and complex neurodevelopmental disorders; adult-onset apraxia of speech (AAS) consequent to stroke and primary progressive apraxia of speech; and idiopathic speech delay. Results: Participants with CAS and AAS had significantly lower scores than typically speaking reference participants and speech delay controls on measures posited to assess representational and transcoding processes. Representational deficits differed between CAS and AAS groups, with support for both underspecified linguistic representations and memory/access deficits in CAS, but for only the latter in AAS. CAS-AAS similarities in the age-sex standardized percentages of occurrence of the most frequent type of inappropriate pauses (abrupt) and significant differences in the standardized occurrence of appropriate pauses were consistent with speech processing findings. Conclusions: Results support the hypotheses of core representational and transcoding speech processing deficits in CAS and theoretical coherence of the PM's pause-speech elements with these deficits.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The spectral powers of the modulations of vocal fundamental frequency (fo) less than 3 Hz (low-frequency power, LFP) and between 3 and 8 Hz (middle-frequency power, MFP) had been established to indicate the audiovocal feedback status and vocal efficiency of a speaker, and a resonant voice may enhance the auditory-vocal feedback. This study aims to determine whether the auditory feedback can be augmented by a forward and resonant voice and therefore contribute to the modulations of fo variability. Method: Vocal signals and accelerometric signals of lateral nasal cartilage were obtained from 27 healthy adults who, respectively, sustained vowels /a/ and /i/ with their habitual speaking voice and with a forward-focused voice under three auditory conditions: natural hearing (N0), high-level noise exposure (N90), and low-level noise exposure (N60). Nasal skin vibrations were measured using a nasal accelerometry to reflect voice resonance status. Vocal intensity and fo variability were also analyzed to show the auditory-vocal interactions under varied conditions of auditory feedback and voice resonance. Results: In both N0 and N90 conditions, forward-focused voice showed a significantly lower LFP than the speakers??? habitual voice. In addition, LFP of fo would significantly increase during natural voice production as the voice feedback was greatly masked by high-intensity noise; however, with a forwardfocused voice, the noise-induced variation in LFP was significantly decreased. Under N90, MFP significantly decreased during forward-focused voice production compared with that measured during natural voice production. The stability of fo modulations was not adversely affected by N60. Conclusion: The results support the idea that vocalizing with a forward-focused voice enhances the auditory feedback of the speaker???s own voice and, thus, reduces the variability of fo during sustained phonation, especially when vocalizing in the high noise condition.},

The present systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis aimed to determine the degree of agreement among studies reporting sex differences in cortical activity during language processing. Irrespective of the modality and the specificity of the language task, sex differences in the BOLD signal or cerebral blood flow was highly inconsistent across fMRI and PET studies. On the temporal side, earlier latency of auditory evoked responses for female compared to male participants were consistently observed in EEG studies during both listening and speaking. Overall, the present review and meta-analysis support the theoretical assumption that there are much more similarities than differences between men and women in the human brain during language processing. Subtle but consistent temporal differences are however observed in the auditory processing of phonetic cues during speech perception and production.},

Its diverse symptoms appear with varying degrees of severity affecting the daily life of those who suffer from it. The rate in which dementia progresses depends on different aspects of the treatment, chosen to try to control and slow down the development of the illness. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of cognitive training through a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and the NeuronUp platform in two age groups whose MMSE is between 18-23 MCI (mild dementia). Method: 32 subjects took part in the study. There were 22 subjects in Group 1 (61-69 years of age) and 10 subjects in Group 2 (70-81 years of age). The criterium for the selection of the groups was to identify the age range with greater improvements due to the training. In order to estimate neuropsychological performance, the subjects were evaluated with the Luria-DNA neuropsychological battery before and after training. This design enables us to evaluate five cognitive areas: visuospatial, spoken language, memory, intellectual processes and attention. Results: After training, Group 1 showed significant improvements in almost all the variables measured when compared with Group 2. This reveals a significant increase in cognitive ability, the degree of which depends on the age. Conclusion: People with mild dementia may delay cognitive impairment with a suitable cognitive training program.},

	shorttitle = {Carry-over fluency induced by extreme prolongations},
	doi = {10.1016/j.mehy.2016.02.013},
	abstract = {Extreme prolongations, which can be generated via extreme delayed auditory feedback (DAF) (e.g., 250-500 ms) or mediated cognitively with timing applications (e.g., analog stopwatch) at 2 s per syllable, have long been behavioral techniques used to inhibit stuttering. Some therapies have used this rate solely to establish initial fluency, while others use extremely slowed speech to establish fluency and add other strategic techniques such as easy onsets and diaphragmatic breathing. Extreme prolongations generate effective, efficient, and immediate forward flowing fluent speech, removing the signature behaviors of discrete stuttering (i.e., syllable repetitions and audible and inaudible postural fixations). Prolonged use of extreme prolongations establishes carry-over fluency, which is spontaneous, effortless speech absent of most, if not all, overt and covert manifestations of stuttering. The creation of this immediate fluency and the immense potential of extreme prolongations to generate long periods of carry-over fluency have been overlooked by researchers and clinicians alike. Clinicians depart from these longer prolongation durations as they attempt to achieve the same fluent results at a near normal rate of speech. Clinicians assume they are re-teaching fluency and slow rates will give rise to more normal rates with less control, but without carry-over fluency, controls and cognitive mediation are always needed for the inherently unstable speech systems of persons who stutter to experience fluent speech. The assumption being that the speech system is untenable without some level of cognitive and motoric monitoring that is always necessary. The goal is omnipresent "near normal rate sounding fluency" with continuous mediation via cognitive and motoric processes. This pursuit of "normal sounding fluency" continues despite ever-present relapse. Relapse has become so common that acceptance of stuttering is the new therapy modality because relapse has come to be understood as somewhat inevitable. Researchers and clinicians fail to recognize that immediate amelioration of stuttering and its attendant carry-over fluency are signs of a different pathway to fluency. In this path, clinicians focus on extreme prolongations and the extent of their carry-over. While fluency is automatically generated under these extreme prolongations, the realization is that communication at this rate in routine speaking tasks is not feasible. The perceived solution is a systematic reduction in the duration of these prolongations, which attempts to approximate "normal speech." Typically, the reintroduction of speech at a normalized rate precipitates a laborious style that is undesirable to the person who stutters (PWS) and is discontinued, once departed from the comforts of the clinical setting. The inevitable typically occurs; the well-intentioned therapist instructs the PWS to focus on the techniques while speaking at a rate that is nearest normal speech, but the overlooked extreme prolongations are unlikely to ever be revisited. The foundation of this hypothesis is that the departure from fluency generators (e.g. extreme prolongations) is the cause of regression to the stuttering set point. In turn, we postulate that the continued use of extreme prolongations, as a solitary practice method, will establish and nurture different neural pathways that will create a modality of fluent speech, able to be experienced without cognitive or motoric mediation. This would therefore result in fewer occurrences of stuttering due to a phenomenon called carry-over fluency. Thus, we hypothesize that the use of extreme prolongations fosters neural pathways for fluent speech, which will result in carry-over fluency that does not require mediation by the speaker.

Results showed a strong correlation between ACTFL OPI and ACTFL OPIc ratings (tau = 0.79, p {\textless} .001), though ACTFL OPIc ratings were slightly higher on average. No significant order effects were found, indicating the order of test administration did not influence ratings. The reliability of both tests was confirmed, and no significant biases were detected. The findings suggest that both ACTFL OPI and ACTFL OPIc are effective, holistic measures of Spanish oral proficiency, with ACTFL OPIc offering a slight advantage in rating outcomes. Pedagogically, this suggests flexibility in test choice without compromising assessment integrity.},

A case study with two experienced test examiner-cum-English lecturers was conducted. Inductive content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data findings obtained from individual semi-structured interviews. Drawbacks, merits, and standardization issues of the current localized speaking assessment frameworks, i.e., the Vietnamese Standardized Test of English Proficiency (VSTEP), were also discussed, especially in comparison to internationally recognized examinations and frameworks such as the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) as well as the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). The study informed both English educators and policymakers to improve localized speaking assessment to suit the local teaching needs while still meeting the requirements of widely accepted international proficiency tests.},

Therefore, the objective of this study was to gauge rating scale functioning of five CEFR oral assessment criteria (overall impression, range, accuracy, fluency and coherence), based on ratings awarded by intermediate ESL learners during self- and peer assessments of their speaking skills. Before learners embarked on awarding ratings to their own performance as well as their peers,' they were trained to understand and apply the criteria and the corresponding ratings based on the benchmarked videos provided on the CEFR official website. Findings on rater measurement report suggest that learners were within productive measurement range based on their infit and outfit mean-squares and the reliability of their ratings was reported at 0.91. However, only four out of six rating categories were utilized in all five CEFR oral assessment criteria and this was illustrated through category probability curve for each criterion. The implications of the findings are discussed in view of learner performance and classroom instruction.},

French university students (N = 216) of varying proficiency levels rated a series of can-do statements related to speaking skills. They then completed the ACTFL OPIc test, which was rated by certified ACTFL raters. A series of regression analyses showed that the strength of the relationship between self-assessment and OPIc ratings was strongly influenced by the type of numeric scale used: When data were ranked ordinally and analyzed using an ordinal regression, a majority (65\%) of variance in OPIc scores was explained by self-assessment scores. Analyzed using linear regression, when scores were converted to equal-interval scales, selfassessment scores explained approximately 30\% of variance. On a graduated scale that reflected the increasing distances between ACTFL (2012) proficiency levels, only 20\% of variance was accounted for.},

Several advantages have been associated with this method, including practicality and authenticity (Taylor, 2003). Nevertheless, concerns have also been raised in terms of the interlocutor effect in paired speaking tests, particularly in regard to the interlocutor's oral proficiency (e.g., Norton, 2005). The present study reports on an approximate replication of Davis (2009), who looked at the effect of interlocutor proficiency on paired speaking assessments. The current study compared the oral performance of 24 university students in two different pairing conditions: once paired with a partner of the same proficiency level and once with a partner of a different proficiency level. Results of this replication study partially confirmed Davis's (2009) results. There were only minimal differences in test-takers' scores between both conditions. A multi-facet Rasch analysis confirmed these results indicating that the pairing conditions were equivalent in difficulty. There were, however, observable differences in the quantity of talk depending on the interlocutor's proficiency. Unlike Davis (2009), this study found that low-proficiency test-takers produced fewer words when paired with high-proficiency partners. Even though the number of words produced by test takers was affected by their partner's proficiency, their performance scores remained constant.},

However, research has seldom addressed L2 comprehensibility and accentedness in relation to speakers' proficiency in the target language. This study explores L2 English comprehensibility and accentedness across three proficiency levels. The speakers were 60 teenaged Finns, half of them speaking Finnish as their L1 and half speaking Finland-Swedish as their L1. Using 20-s speech samples, the comprehensibility and accentedness of the speakers were rated by 34 English-speaking teenagers on a 9-point scale. Comparisons were made regarding comprehensibility and accentedness between L1 Finnish and L1 Finland-Swedish speakers, and the data were also analysed for a possible relationship between the ratings and the speakers' overall oral proficiency in English. The results revealed a surprising difference between the language groups for speakers at proficiency levels B1-B2: Despite an equal proficiency assessment, L1 Finland-Swedish speakers were rated as more comprehensible and less accented than L1 Finnish speakers. Overall, the ratings were found to correlate with the speakers' oral proficiency, but the correlations were rather weak and the steps from one proficiency level to another often had only small effects on comprehensibility and accentedness.},

These characteristics are part of what is commonly referred to as floor and ceiling scoring. In this binary approach to scoring that differentiates between sustained performance and linguistic breakdown, raters evaluate many features including vocabulary use, grammatical accuracy, pronunciation, and pragmatics, yet there has been very little empirical validation on the practice of floor/ceiling scoring. This study examined the relationship between temporal oral fluency, prompt type, and proficiency level based on a data set comprised of 147 Oral Proficiency Interview - computer (OPIc) exam responses whose ratings ranged from Intermediate Low to Advanced High [AH]. As speakers progressed in proficiency, they were more fluent. In terms of floor and ceiling scoring, the prompts that elicited speech a level above the sustained level generally resulted in speech that was slower and had more breakdown than the floor-level prompts, though the differences were slight and not significantly different. Thus, temporal fluency features alone are insufficient in floor/ceiling scoring but are likely a contributing feature.},

Two years of OPIc score data from 814 students studying Chinese (n = 143), French (n = 251), Spanish (n = 374), and Russian (n = 46) were collected, together with survey data on language learning experiences and motivation. Each participant had two to four OPIc scores. A growth curve analysis using mixed-effect modeling revealed that language learning experience and motivation explained approximately 43\% of variation in initial proficiency and 23\% of variation in rates of change over time. The target language had no unique effects on initial proficiency or change over time. On average, learners gained roughly one-third of an ACTFL sublevel per semester of study (while controlling for differences in their backgrounds). Findings are informative for appropriate interpretations and uses of OPIc scores in tertiary educational settings, but also question individual growth-tracking suitability on a semester-by-semester basis.},

Next, it describes the use of placement tests with a special emphasis on the Simple Performance Oriented Test (SPOT) and the Japanese Computerized Adaptive Test (J-CAT). These tests were originally developed as placement tests, but their uses have expanded in the years since their creation. Third, this article considers the development and the use of self-assessment tools. In particular, it explains how the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) triggered both the development of a Japanese version of the CEFR (JF Standard) and discussion about Japanese as a second language (JSL) curriculum and instructional methodologies. Finally, this article examines Japanese for Specific Purposes (JSP) tests.

Results were compared to see how accurate the self-assessments were and to determine if the students' self-assessment skills improved. Most students' OPIc gains were reflected in their self-assessment gains; meanwhile, learners tended to underassess rather than overassess their skills. Students at the Novice and Advanced proficiency levels were more accurate self-assessors than were Intermediate-level learners. There was no difference in self-assessment rating accuracy between Years 1 and 2. The findings suggest that self-assessment based on the Can-Do Statements is valuable for low-stakes assessments: for example, to monitor students' proficiency gains and to globally track the way in which language programs promote proficiency growth.},

	abstract = {Two assumptions of speaking proficiency tests are that the speech produced is spontaneous and the the scores on those tests predict what examinees can do in real-world communicative situations. Therefore, when examinees memorize scripts for their oral responses, the validity of the score interpretation is threatened. While the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) Proficiency Guidelines identify rehearsed content as a major hindrance to interviewees being rated above Novice High, many examinees still prepare for speaking tests by memorizing and rehearsing scripts hoping these "performances" are awarded higher scores. To investigate this phenomenon, researchers screened 300 previously rated Oral Proficiency Interview-computer (OPIc) tests and found 39 examinees who had at least one response that had been tagged as rehearsed. Each examinee's responses were then transcribed, and the spontaneous and rehearsed tasks were compared. Temporal fluency articulation rates differed significantly between the spontaneous and rehearsed segments; however, the strongest evidence of memorization lay in the transcriptions and the patterns that emerged within and across interviews. Test developers, therefore, need to be vigilant in creating scoring guidelines for rehearsed content.},

Students at all levels of instruction made significant gains in speaking proficiency, with greater gains made by students in Level 1 than at Levels 2-3, and with wide variation within instructional levels. The average speaking proficiency outcomes were Advanced Low (Level 3), Intermediate High (Level 2), and between Intermediate Low and Intermediate Mid (Level 1). What gains in speaking proficiency can students in intensive postsecondary language programs expect to make? Do students make similar gains when those programs are offered online?

The speech samples were recorded by five Brazilians. There were two data collection sessions, with the second one occurring 7-8 months after the first one. The results indicate high levels of agreement among raters for all scales. Furthermore, the raters detected changes in speakers' performance in four out of five scales: L2 oral proficiency, vocabulary, grammar, and fluency, and these differences in rates across time were significant for oral proficiency, vocabulary, and fluency. Thus, the different types of scale allow detecting L2 oral proficiency development.},

Chinese, German, and Spanish language learners (n = 101) completed three different self-assessments before taking the OPIc. Self-assessment results across the three tools were then compared to the OPIc ratings ultimately achieved by the learners. Although accuracy in the selection of level-appropriate OPIc forms was generally quite high, success rates were higher with a global 10-point self-assessment instrument.

The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) computer-assisted Oral Proficiency Interview (OPIc) provided the pretest and posttest measures for this study. To supplement this data, course surveys provided information concerning student opinions of course activities. OPIc results showed that students made significant gains in their oral proficiency from pretest to posttest. In surveys, students rated interaction with other tutors and teachers as instrumental in assisting them with their language learning, but rated interaction with their peers as less helpful.},

Students' oral proficiency was assessed at the beginning and end of the semester via the OPI, and oral performance was assessed during the middle and at the end of the semester with VOICES. During the semester, learners practiced with structured and communicative output activities with the purpose of developing communicative competence. Using active learning as a pedagogical approach and reflective practice based on Schon's principles (1987), Spanish instruction was focused on conscious awareness, scaffolding, autonomous and meaningful communication as a way to improve the performance of oral tasks. The study employs the convergent design (Creswell \& Plano Clark, 2011) that entails the collection of qualitative and quantitative data sets to provide a better understanding of the best practices for teaching and assessing speaking. Participants in this study were 13 undergraduate students at a large public university in the Midwest of the United States and one instructor. They were enrolled in an intermediate Spanish conversation course designed for professionals. The use of active learning and reflective practice contributed positively to building a comfortable and engaging learning environment.},

However, offering courses in multiple formats presents the challenges of developing high quality online courses and assessing the overall program effectiveness as students may elect to take the sequenced language acquisition courses in different formats.

The purpose of this study was to examine a second language program offering both seated and online Spanish language acquisition classes at a small regional campus in the Midwest. Oral proficiency was tested using the Pearson Versant Test for Spanish and students' (n=108) scores were then compared to the ACTFL established benchmarks after one and two years of language study. In this study 42\% met or exceeded the first year overall oral proficiency benchmark of Intermediate-Low and 27.5\% met or exceeded the second year overall benchmark of Intermediate-Mid. These results suggest online Spanish course options can be an effective mode for students to meet oral proficiency benchmarks when programs require asynchronous and synchronous oral production, and provide speaking practice opportunities.

To investigate this, 253 end-of-second-year students were divided into two experimental conditions: (a) 95 students received up to 10\% of their final grade based on meeting the speaking goal, and (b) 73 students received up to 5\% of their grade on the same criterion. Eighty-five students formed a control group with no grading incentive. All took ACTFL tests in speaking (the Oral Proficiency Interview-computerized [OPIc]), listening (Listening Proficiency Test), and reading (Reading Proficiency Test). The group whose OPIc score counted for 10\% performed significantly higher than other two groups. Females were more positively affected by the incentivization.

	abstract = {Objectives: The present study examined if time-pressured administration of an expanded Multilingual Naming Test (MINT) would improve or compromise assessment of bilingual language proficiency and language dominance. Methods: Eighty Spanish-English bilinguals viewed a grid with 80 MINT-Sprint pictures and were asked to name as many pictures as possible in 3 min in each language in counterbalanced order. An Oral Proficiency Interview rated by four native Spanish-English bilinguals provided independent assessment of proficiency level. Bilinguals also self-rated their proficiency, completed two subtests of the Woodcock-Munoz, and a speeded translation recognition test. We compared scores after 2 min, a first-pass through all the pictures, and a second-pass in which bilinguals were prompted to try to name skipped items. Results: The MINT Sprint and a subset score including original MINT items were highly correlated with Oral Proficiency Interview scores for predicting the degree of language dominance - matching or outperforming all other measures. Self-ratings provided weaker measures (especially of degree of balance - i.e., bilingual index scores) and did not explain any unique variance in measuring the degree of language dominance when considered together with second-pass naming scores. The 2-min scoring procedure did not improve and appeared not to hamper assessment of absolute proficiency level but prompting to try to name skipped items improved assessment of language dominance and naming scores, especially in the nondominant language. Conclusions: Time-pressured rapid naming saves time without significantly compromising assessment of proficiency level. However, breadth of vocabulary knowledge may be as important as retrieval speed for maximizing the accuracy in proficiency assessment.},

Learners used the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages Proficiency Guidelines to guide self-analyses of their oral production at intervals throughout the course. The intent was to provide opportunities for learners to develop an understanding of what constitutes oral proficiency, gauge their own progress, and set personal goals. Learners' self-analysis narratives suggested they began to notice different aspects of their speech and to better articulate their abilities and limitations. Broadly speaking, the results suggest that self-assessment of oral performance guided by the Proficiency Guidelines is an effective way to increase FL students' language awareness and self-efficacy. Pedagogical implications and limitations to this approach are discussed.},

The typical test tasks aimed at oral proficiency assessment, recommended by the State Russian as a Foreign Language Testing System and ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview, were used. Main results of this study are: (1) there is a strong and significant relationship between the test takers' ethnics and gender, on the one hand, and test performance, on the other hand; (2) certain types of the test tasks provoke the test takers' communicative failures, caused by gender and ethnic blockages, barriers and taboos on realization of discourse and behavioral strategies; (3) these communicative misfits may not be corrected or eliminated by didactic means, e.g. or special training, since they are determined by ethnic moral norms and standards. The results of the study may be implemented in the system of teaching foreign languages and language proficiency testing, they may be useful for the test developers, the test administrators and foreign language teachers.},

	abstract = {This study analyzed the relationship between enjoyment and oral English proficiency in Peruvian future teachers. It previously validated a measurement instrument of enjoyment setting for future teachers who are learners of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and then delved into understanding the role of enjoyment as a predictor of oral proficiency. The sample comprised 119 students from a State Higher School of Education in Peru, randomly selected from various careers and grouped according to English language competency levels ranging from A1 to B1+ based on a subscale inspired by the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). Students' oral proficiency was evaluated using a rubric covering five aspects, and enjoyment was assessed through a nine-question questionnaire. The results initially demonstrated a significant positive relationship (r = 0.900, p {\textless} 0.001) between enjoyment and oral proficiency in EFL. Secondly, a linear regression model determined that enjoyment was a highly significant predictor (beta = 0.957, p {\textless} 0.001) of oral proficiency. These findings support the importance of enjoyment in developing oral proficiency as a reliable tool to predict oral proficiency in EFL in the context of EFL teacher education. This study highlighted a significant influence of enjoyment on oral proficiency in learning EFL to prospective teachers. Results analysis underscored the importance of enjoyment as a significant predictor of oral proficiency, suggesting that promoting enjoyment in the learning and teaching process can be an effective strategy to foster significant development of oral skills in English. These findings have significant implications for teacher education, emphasizing the need to integrate activities and psycho-pedagogical approaches that promote enjoyment in the English classroom. Furthermore, the proposed model was validated as a reliable tool to assess teachers' enjoyment of learning EFL. Understanding and nurturing enjoyment in learning English can significantly enhance the oral English proficiency of future teachers and, ultimately, contribute to a more robust command of the EFL.},

The data were gathered from the content analyses of video recordings of oral proficiency exam belonging to 190 EFL learners with different proficiency levels according to the description of CEFR and the course book used at School of Foreign Languages at a state university in Turkey. The findings indicate that EFL learners used formulaic language which they were exposed to through their course books in oral proficiency exams with different tasks; they used more formulaic language in the paired tasks in which they interact with another exam taker and their use was significantly related to their scores of fluency and language proficiency.},

This article presents results of a study that focused on the empirical robustness (i.e. the power of level descriptions to capture what learners actually do in a language test) of the CEFR vocabulary \& fluency scales (A2-B2). Data stem from an Italian \& German oral proficiency test (Abel et al. 2012). Results show that the empirical robustness was flawed: Some scale contents were hardly observable or so evenly distributed that they could not distinguish between learners. Contradictory/weak correlations among scale features and heterogeneous cluster solutions suggest that scales did not consistently capture typical learner behaviour. Often, learner language could not be objectively described by any level description. Also, it was only partially possible to link scale contents to research-based measures of fluency and vocabulary. Given the importance of CEFR levels in many high-stakes contexts, the results suggest the need of a large empirical validation project.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an index based on the developmental levels of second language (L2) morphological and syntactic forms (Index of Developmental Levels, IDL) predict L2 oral proficiency and learners' institutional placement in different class-levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and whether IDL is a better predictor of these variables compared to widely-used structural complexity measures (mean length of AS-unit and subordination measure).

Each speech-sample was rated for oral proficiency by two expert raters using the TOEFL independent speaking rubric. The results showed IDL as a significant positive predictor of L2 oral proficiency scores and learners' placement in class-levels. IDL was also found to be a stronger predictor of learners' oral proficiency and institutional placement compared to subordination measure. The results are discussed with reference to the importance of including developmentally based measures for gaining informed insights into L2 oral performances. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study explores how bilingual oral proficiency develops over a semester and examines the influence of bilingual profile, learner type, and initial proficiency on language growth.Methods Twenty-three bilingual learners-primarily heritage Spanish speakers-enrolled in a semester-long translation and interpreting program. Participants completed background questionnaires and ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPIs) in English and Spanish at the beginning and end of the semester.Results Overall, there were no statistically significant gains in English or Spanish oral proficiency for either heritage or second language learners. However, students with lower initial proficiency levels demonstrated greater gains across the semester, suggesting that initial proficiency is a key factor influencing short-term language development.Discussion These findings highlight the complexity of bilingual development and the uneven trajectory of language growth within mixed learner groups. Translation and interpreting coursework may serve not only as professional preparation but also as a vehicle for enhancing bilingual proficiency, particularly for students at intermediate levels. Although conducted at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, the study's implications extend to other higher education contexts serving bilingual or multilingual populations.},

The paper also reports the challenges and strategies employed in carrying out the speaking assessments following the CEFR while adhering to the SOP. The study employed a qualitative research method that utilised semi-structured interviews to elicit information from four teachers who taught in eight schools within Niigata City, Japan. Findings suggest that prior to the implementation of CEFR, not all teachers carried out speaking assessments. However, the implementation of CEFR emphasised the need to teach speaking and carry out speaking assessments. The CEFR also served as guidance for the teachers in preparing the assessment scoring rubrics. The results also showed that the speaking assessments were implemented individually instead of in groups before the pandemic and the presence of the masks, which increased the student's anxiety and affected their performance. However, the teachers employed various strategies to overcome the challenges by modifying the assessment tasks and utilising web conferencing technology.},

Although there has been a proliferation of studies in this field, research oriented toward assessment and evaluation in HL education has been limited. This article addresses three major areas of research on the design and implementation of assessment for adult HLLs and the evaluation of the programs that serve them. First, the article examines the considerable ongoing discussion of appropriate HL assessments, in particular the applicability of the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines (ACTFL, 2012). Next, it examines investigations of different sociocultural factors that may predict HL proficiency. Finally, the article considers the small but growing line of research on the evaluation of HL programs, often conducted through national-level surveys or through the systematic evaluation of HL programs. Developing from these existing lines of inquiry, the review offers a number of recommendations to improve future research in this area.},

	abstract = {This study details the impact of incorporating social semiotic theory and smartphone photography into English as a second language (L2) instruction on oral proficiency over a six-month experimental project. During the project, participants were guided to deconstruct photographs into visual elements based on the theory's three metafunctions. Smartphone photography served as the medium that linked the social context, its visual resources, and classroom instruction. The study aimed to evaluate the enhancement in oral proficiency of 54 upper-intermediate Iranian English Language Learners (ELLs) in dimensions including complexity, accuracy, and fluency. The oral performances on smartphone photo description tasks were rated using a standardized scoring system based on dimensions of oral proficiency. A Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) revealed that the participants in the experimental group were able to produce utterances that were more grammatically accurate, contained more subordinates, utilized a greater variety of words (both in terms of types and tokens), and were longer in length. Additionally, the speech rate of the participants also increased. Despite the promising findings of the study, its limitations, such as the specific group of learners and the limited period of study, may affect the generalizability of the results. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating technology and social semiotics in L2 education. The observed improvements in learners' oral proficiency suggest that the integration could enhance language learning and teaching practices.},

The participants were 203 Chinese as a Second Language (CSL) learners recruited from regions and countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. Structural equation models (SEMs) were employed to analyse the data. The results demonstrate that linguistic identification contributed to Chinese oral complexity directly, but showed weak or no direct influence on accuracy or fluency. Although learning motivation exerted a weak influence on Chinese oral accuracy, it mediated the path from linguistic identification to oral accuracy. Finally, it was found that linguistic identification significantly influenced learning motivation. This study contributes to the research on second language (L2) learning from a sociocultural perspective, and provides implications for CSL teaching and learning.},

Forty-five students were randomly assigned to individual or paired learning (with 'Lead' and 'Assisting' roles interacting with TalkFriend). Employing a multi-modal approach, we uniquely integrated EEG brainwave data with oral tests, questionnaires, and interviews. Findings revealed significant overall proficiency gains. Notably, paired learning fostered superior improvements in communicative confidence and fluency compared to individual learning, which primarily saw fluency gains. Lead learners in paired settings also exhibited markedly higher learning interest, a factor significantly correlating with their neural activity (EEG). Pronunciation accuracy appeared to develop independently. Interpreted through Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), these findings inform a proposed four-quadrant 'emotional ZPD' conceptual model, highlighting the crucial interplay of cognitive, affective, and social support (from both AI and peers). Our research offers critical neurocognitive and sociointeractional insights for optimizing AI tools in language education.},

However, previous studies often overlook the significance of recognizing and adapting to individual learner characteristics. Such adaptation is crucial for enhancing student engagement and learning efficiency, particularly in mathematics instruction, where diverse learning styles require personalized strategies to promote comprehension and enthusiasm. In this paper, we propose a PersonAlized Conversational tutoring agEnt (PACE) for mathematics instruction. PACE simulates students' learning styles based on the Felder and Silverman learning style model, aligning with each student's persona. In this way, our PACE can effectively assess the personality of students, allowing to develop individualized teaching strategies that resonate with their unique learning styles. To further enhance students' comprehension, PACE employs the Socratic teaching method to provide instant feedback and encourage deep thinking. By constructing personalized teaching data and training models, PACE demonstrates the ability to identify and adapt to the unique needs of each student, significantly improving the overall learning experience and outcomes. Moreover, we establish multi-aspect evaluation criteria and conduct extensive analysis to assess the performance of personalized teaching. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model in personalizing the educational experience and motivating students compared to existing methods.},

	abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that imitate human tutors and aim to provide immediate and customized instructions or feedback to learners have shown their effectiveness in education. With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) further entitle the systems to complex and coherent conversational interactions. These systems would be of great help in language education as it involves developing skills in communication, which, however, drew relatively less attention. Additionally, due to the complicated cognitive development at younger ages, more endeavors are needed for practical uses. Scaffolding refers to a teaching technique where teachers provide support and guidance to students for learning and developing new concepts or skills. It is an effective way to support diverse learning needs, goals, processes, and outcomes. In this work, we investigate how pedagogical instructions facilitate the scaffolding in ITSs, by conducting a case study on guiding children to describe images for language learning. We construct different types of scaffolding tutoring systems grounded in four fundamental learning theories: knowledge construction, inquiry-based learning, dialogic teaching, and zone of proximal development. For qualitative and quantitative analyses, we build and refine a seven-dimension rubric to evaluate the scaffolding process. In our experiment on GPT-4V, we observe that LLMs demonstrate strong potential to follow pedagogical instructions and achieve self-paced learning in different student groups. Moreover, we extend our evaluation framework from a manual to an automated approach, paving the way to benchmark various conversational tutoring systems.},

Collecting such datasets remains challenging, as recording tutoring sessions raises privacy concerns and crowdsourcing leads to insufficient data quality. To address this, we propose a framework to generate such dialogues by pairing human teachers with a Large Language Model (LLM) prompted to represent common student errors. We describe how we use this framework to collect MATHDIAL, a dataset of 3k one-to-one teacher-student tutoring dialogues grounded in multi-step math reasoning problems. While models like GPT-3 are good problem solvers, they fail at tutoring because they generate factually incorrect feedback or are prone to revealing solutions to students too early. To overcome this, we let teachers provide learning opportunities to students by guiding them using various scaffolding questions according to a taxonomy of teacher moves. We demonstrate MATHDIAL and its extensive annotations can be used to fine-tune models to be more effective tutors (and not just solvers). We confirm this by automatic and human evaluation, notably in an interactive setting that measures the trade-off between student solving success and telling solutions. The dataset is released publicly.},

To examine age effects separately from the effect of general language proficiency, we analysed learners' interaction in both their first language (L1) and FL. We observed the students as they engaged in an assessment consisting of a set of decision-making tasks with their peers. After each task, the students self-assessed their performance. We found differences in interactions across grade levels in both L1 and FL with respect to holistic interactional patterns, topic development, and turn-taking patterns. The students' understanding of communicative interactive tasks also appeared to differ between grade levels, perhaps reflecting their experiential differences with communicative tasks in class.

	doi = {10.12753/2066-026X-15-248},
	abstract = {The paper is an investigation of the underlying factors that eventually lead to achieving autonomy and automaticity in the process of language learning. It starts from an experimental procedure of assessing speaking among students in Tourism, at Babes-Bolyai University. Initially designed as a task for developing fluency outside the classroom context (the test of real linguistic autonomy), the recorded spoken productions of students in Tourism were integrated in the final assessment. The paper discusses the importance of a task-based approach, a task-based syllabus and of collaborative tasks. It also questions the way technology assists the teaching and assessment practices by looking into the advantages of using wikis in and outside the classroom context. As ICT skills are included in the spectrum of academic prerequisites, the role of media and technology-assisted learning, teaching and assessing has become evident. As assessing speaking is time and resource-consuming, solutions to making it more efficient and less class-dependent must be identified. Another key-issue that the paper addresses is that of authenticity: the authenticity of tasks, of context, of participants. Students' recorded productions were organized in an authentic context (hotel industry) and this helps develop communicative competence and an awareness of the needs of the job market. From a pedagogical perspective, a selection of the video recordings presented in class offered students the possibility to self-assess and inter-assess their linguistic competence (use of checklists). The role of feedback and washback is further analyzed in relation to the question of the assessment impact on the overall teaching practice. This, in turn, should closely respect the basic principles of assessment (feasibility, validity, authenticity), as they are formulated in the Common European Framework of Languages.},

	abstract = {When assessing L2 performance in task-based research, dimensions of complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) have typically been evaluated. Less attention has, however, been devoted to the functional dimension. This paper argues that it is critical to consider the functional dimension of L2 performance in addition to complexity, accuracy, and fluency. Functional adequacy as a task-related construct is viewed in the present study as a component of L2 pragmatics, referring to the appropriateness and felicity of the utterances of the speaker/writer within a particular context, and evaluated by the listener/reader. The study investigates the applicability of a rating scale developed for the assessment of functional adequacy in the L2, considered from the perspective of task-based language teaching (TBLT) and task-based language assessment (TBLA), as successful task completion. In the rating scale, four components of functional adequacy are distinguished: content, task requirements, comprehensibility, and coherence and cohesion. A group of non-expert raters judged the oral and written samples of two groups of university students of Dutch L2 and Italian L2. The results show that the scale appears to be a reliable and efficient tool for assessing the functional adequacy of written and spoken L2 production.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Impairments of speech are common in patients with glioma and negatively impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The benchmark for clinical assessments is task-based measures, which are not always feasible to administer and may miss essential components of HRQoL. In this study, the authors tested the hypothesis that variations in natural language (NL) correlate with HRQoL in a pattern distinct from task-based measures of language performance. METHODS NL use was assessed using audio samples collected unobtrusively from 18 patients with newly diagnosed low- and high-grade glioma. NL measures were calculated using manual segmentation and correlated with Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) outcomes. Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to determine relationships between Neuro-QoL scores and NL measures. RESULTS The distribution of NL measures across the entire patient cohort included a mean +/- SD total time speaking of 11.5 +/- 2.20 seconds, total number of words of 27.2 +/- 4.44, number of function words of 10.9 +/- 1.68, number of content words of 16.3 +/- 2.91, and speech rate of 2.61 +/- 0.20 words/second. Speech rate was negatively correlated with functional domains (rho = -0.62 and p = 0.007 for satisfaction with social roles; rho = -0.74 and p {\textless} 0.001 for participation in social roles) but positively correlated with impairment domains (rho = 0.58 and p = 0.009 for fatigue) of Neuro-QoL. CONCLUSIONS Assessment of NL at the time of diagnosis may be a useful measure in the context of treatment planning and monitoring outcomes for adult patients with glioma.},

However, many instructors lack the tools and training needed to design SSP curricula that meet learners' communicative needs in such contexts. Moreover, little SSP research to date has taken a task-based approach to identifying learners' specialized needs (Long, 2015), which can provide much-needed support to instructors who are nonexperts in the particular domain of interest. The current study reports on a small-scale, multiphase needs analysis carried out to design a university business Spanish course. In Phase 1, a small sample of business graduates and professionals generated a list of 40 target tasks in the domains of reading, writing, listening, and speaking that were relevant to their particular work. In Phase 2, 54 university business majors rated the frequency and difficulty of each task on a 40-item Likert-type questionnaire. During Phase 3, the researchers analyzed and grouped target tasks identified in the needs assessment to create five major target task types that informed course objectives and classroom tasks.},

Students who enrol on this degree course arrive with varying degrees of language ability and diverse language learning backgrounds; due to the disparate nature of their proficiency levels, fostering language learning awareness is crucial. Task-based activities are fundamental to this approach, enabling students to explore and develop their communicative language competences through authentic target language use, and to reflect on their progress through guided self-and peer assessment. In the article, we will showcase examples of tasks which demonstrate the approach adopted. We will first explore how peer assessment of audio recordings was used in a course where first-year students were aiming to develop their spoken production skills. We will then illustrate how second-year students engaged in self-assessment of their skills in activities designed to explore the language of interaction and production. Finally, we will focus on the use of the ELP Dossier as a pedagogical tool, with students compiling an Academic Dossier and reflecting on the choices of work to include in it.},

Functional MRI (fMRI) is considered the most useful to determine language lateralization noninvasively. However, there are no standardized language fMRI protocols, and several issues remain unresolved. In particular, the language tasks normally used are predominantly active paradigms that require the overt participation of patients, making assessment difficult for pediatric patients or patients with intellectual disabilities. In this study, task-based fMRI with passive narrative listening was applied to evaluate speech comprehension to estimate language function in Japanese-speaking patients with drug-resistant TLE. Methods: Twenty-one patients (six with intellectual disabilities) participated. Patients listened to passive auditory stimuli with combinations of forward and silent playback, and forward and backward playback. The activation results were extracted using a block design, and lateralization indices were calculated. The obtained fMRI results were compared to the results of the Wada test. Results: The concordance rate between fMRI and the Wada test was 95.2\%. Meaningful responses were successfully obtained even from participants with intellectual disabilities. Conclusions: This passive fMRI paradigm can provide safe and easy presurgical language evaluation, particularly for individuals who may not readily engage in active paradigms.},

We describe how the participants jointly manage to enter the task by deploying diverse preliminaries through pre-pre sequences, pre-question sequences and pre-telling sequences as sequential practices, and story-prefaces as turn design features. In so doing, they project the main actions in mutually recognisable ways and collaboratively accomplish the instructed actions in the complementary role cards. We argue that preliminaries used for entering the task talk mark the primary point for the participants to display their L2 ICs in the focal task-based assessment context. The findings bring conversation analytic insights into L2 IC and provide implications for assessment interactions.},

Applying a conversation analysis technique, this study examined how second language (L2) learners managed topics in L2 task-based text-chat interactions and the effects of L2 proficiency on their interactional practices. Participants were 53 dyads, comprising 106 Japanese learners of English across three proficiency levels. The findings demonstrated that only high -proficiency learners jointly constructed differences in topicality between on-and off-task interactions, by implementing resources available in the textual communication medium. Mid-and low-proficiency learners tended to recycle similar formats to create new sequences. In addition, low-proficiency learners never showed orientation to topic transition in an observable way; mid-proficiency learners did show an indication of such an orientation to topic transition, although they failed to achieve it interactionally. The findings were partially verified by quantifying the question format How about you? , which was predominantly used by low-and mid-proficiency learners. Based on the findings, this study proposes a hypothetical developmental pathway and pedagogical implications for teaching and assessment of interactional competencies in L2 written interactions.},

Additionally, to investigate differences in the perception of specific phonemes and the association between speech perception and speech production skills. Method. Twenty-five Australian-English speaking children aged 48-60 months participated in this study. The SSD group included 12 children and the typically developing (TD) group included 13 children. Children completed routine speech and language assessments in addition to an experimental Australian-English lexical and phonetic judgement task based on Rvachew's Speech Assessment and Interactive Learning System (SAILS) program (Rvachew, 2009). This task included eight words across four word-initial phonemes-/k, (sic), integral, s/. Results: Children with SSD showed significantly poorer perceptual accuracy on the lexical and phonetic judgement task compared with TD peers. The phonemes /(sic)/ and /s/ were most frequently perceived in error across both groups. Additionally, the phoneme /(sic)/ was most commonly produced in error. There was also a positive correlation between overall speech perception and speech production scores. Conclusions: Children with SSD perceived speech less accurately than their typically developing peers. The findings suggest that an Australian-English variation of a lexical and phonetic judgement task similar to the SAILS program is promising and worthy of a larger scale study.},

This study analyzed the results of an assessment measure that followed a classroom intervention in immersion and non-immersion contexts with 48 English-speaking beginner learners of L2 Russian. Learners were introduced to accusative noun case endings through awareness raising activities, extensive task-based interpretation and production practice. The results show that systematically directing attention to form-meaning similarities and differences between L1 and L2 supported L2 grammar learning. Masculine and neuter accusative endings were found to pose greater challenges, as were nominative and accusative nouns in non-initial positions in the sentence (i.e., OVS, OSV, SVO, SOV). Beyond its instructional implications, the study offers insights into the underlying linguistic representations created in language immersion and non-immersion contexts.},

How does the use of discourse markers differ at pragmatic performance levels and task types? The data came from 102 L2 English test-takers' pragmatic performances on monologic and interactive role-play pragmatic assessment tasks, scored by trained raters using analytical rating criteria. Sequential mixed methods were employed to answer the research questions. First, the sequential positions and pragmatic functions of discourse markers in task-based performances were analysed using conversation analysis, which formed the basis of a coding scheme and coder training. Second, the coded data were analysed using the CLAN program for quantitative analyses to answer the second research question. The findings revealed that the frequencies and quantitative power of the discourse markers in predicting the pragmatic performance levels were distinct across the task types that differed in terms of pragmatic demands and interactivity. For example, the use of discourse markers which function as transitioners of actions and acknowledgement tokens was more distinguishable for more interactive tasks with less formal pragmatic functions. The findings confirm that the pattern of discourse markers was associated with the pragmatic functions and interactional demands required in the tasks. Implications of the findings in understanding the role of discourse markers in task-based pragmatic teaching and assessment are discussed.},

	abstract = {Following the globalization of businesses and the emergence of the European single market, teaching foreign languages, especially English, at an academic level has entered a new era, as future graduates need to master the terminology of their field of study in order to be prepared to work in multicultural or international environments. This means that the old teaching methods based solely on grammar and vocabulary exercises are no longer sufficient and must be improved and adapted to meet the students' future linguistic needs. Therefore, in order for the graduates to become autonomous users of English for specific purposes, an emphasis must be laid on the functional use of language. This means that a social and situational dimension should be added to the English class. Starting from a project on a task-based approach to testing foreign languages in tertiary education, coordinated by the European Center for Modern Languages (2011), this article is aimed at emphasizing the ways in which this new model can be transferred to teaching and assessing English. The target group is represented, in the present case studies, by Bachelor's degree students from the Faculty of Biology, the University of Bucharest and by Master's degree students enrolled in the programme The Culture and the Language of European Organizations, at the University of Bucharest. This new student-centered approach puts the learners in real-life situations, similar to those they may encounter in their profession one day. By exposing the students to a wide variety of authentic situations and eliciting natural language production, they are encouraged to focus on meaning exchange rather than linguistic accuracy. Therefore, the language teachers have the mission to select the most suitable authentic materials for teaching and to construct accurate evaluation grids for both receptive (listening and reading) and productive skills (writing and speaking). In line with the teaching method, the assessment does not check the acquisition of distinct vocabulary and grammar structures, but it tests learners' ability to accomplish certain given tasks in the target language (English). This new pedagogical approach motivates students more than the traditional methods because, besides functional language proficiency, they develop soft skills, such as critical thinking, problem solving and negotiation skills, which will help them in their future career.},

	abstract = {BackgroundCapturing evidence of the effects of therapy within everyday communication is the holy grail of aphasia treatment design and evaluation. Whilst impaired sentence production is a predominant symptom of Broca's-type aphasia, the effects of sentence production therapy on everyday conversation have not been investigated. Given the context-sensitive nature of spoken production by people with aphasia, it is difficult to extrapolate implications for everyday conversation based on results from task-based assessment (such as picture description, story retell or interview). Thus, there are strong theoretical and clinical motivations to investigate generalization from sentence production treatment to everyday conversation. AimsTo evaluate a theoretically driven treatment focused on the language production skills of participants with post-stroke Broca's aphasia and to track outcomes from psycholinguistic assessment tasks to everyday conversation. Methods \& ProceduresA case series design was utilized with pragmatic selection of participants with chronic aphasia undergoing the same assessment and treatment procedures. Nine participants with Broca's aphasia and their main conversation partners took part in the study. Treatment was implemented once weekly over 8 weeks and targeted production of basic syntaxtwo, three and four constituent constructionsthrough principles of mapping and reduced syntax treatment. Use of different possible exemplars for nouns, particularly pronouns, was trained together with use of both light and heavy verbs. Participants had the opportunity to top-up' therapy practise by completely a homework task that mirrored the therapy task. Outcomes \& ResultsSyntactic well-formedness was assessed in samples of constrained sentence production, narrative retell and naturally occurring conversations at baseline, 1 week post-treatment, and 1 month post-treatment. Treatment showed strong direct effects in trained and untrained sentence construction tasks, with some generalization to narrative retell tasks. There was little evidence of change in everyday conversation. Conclusions \& ImplicationsImprovement in language production in constrained assessment tasks may not impact on everyday conversations. Implications for further research are discussed, e.g. the need for bridging interventions between constrained and unconstrained contexts of language production. Clinical implications include the potential to streamline therapy planning and delivery by making use of rich, hybrid therapies to treat individuals with similar symptom profiles but with a range of underlying deficits.},

	abstract = {Background: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model has attracted considerable attention in clinical applications, such as patient classification and disease prediction. However, current studies have typically progressed to application development without a thorough assessment of the model's comprehension of clinical context. Furthermore, limited comparative studies have been conducted on BERT models using medical documents from non-English-speaking countries. Therefore, the applicability of BERT models trained on English clinical notes to non-English contexts is yet to be confirmed. To address these gaps in literature, this study focused on identifying the most effective BERT model for non-English clinical notes. Objective: In this study, we evaluated the contextual understanding abilities of various BERT models applied to mixed Korean and English clinical notes. The objective of this study was to identify the BERT model that excels in understanding the context of such documents. Methods: Using data from 164,460 patients in a South Korean tertiary hospital, we pretrained BERT-base, BERT for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT), Korean BERT (KoBERT), and Multilingual BERT (M-BERT) to improve their contextual comprehension capabilities and subsequently compared their performances in 7 fine-tuning tasks. Results: The model performance varied based on the task and token usage. First, BERT-base and BioBERT excelled in tasks using classification ([CLS]) token embeddings, such as document classification. BioBERT achieved the highest F1-score of 89.32. Both BERT-base and BioBERT demonstrated their effectiveness in document pattern recognition, even with limited Korean tokens in the dictionary. Second, M-BERT exhibited a superior performance in reading comprehension tasks, achieving an F1-score of 93.77. Better results were obtained when fewer words were replaced with unknown ([UNK]) tokens. Third, M-BERT excelled in the knowledge inference task in which correct disease names were inferred from 63 candidate disease names in a document with disease names replaced with [MASK] tokens. M-BERT achieved the highest hit@10 score of 95.41. Conclusions: This study highlighted the effectiveness of various BERT models in a multilingual clinical domain. The findings can be used as a reference in clinical and language-based applications.},

This study includes two groups of 16-year-old learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) in Taiwan (N = 71). One group carried out assisted repeated reading (i.e., with audio support) once every day for 5 consecutive days (intensive distribution); the other read the same text once every week for 5 consecutive weeks (spaced distribution). The results revealed that intensive practice led to more immediate vocabulary gains but spaced practice led to greater long-term retention.},

Literary texts with simplified language often differ from expository texts for teaching EFL learners. Although reading strategies have been used to facilitate comprehension, how students use strategies to process literary texts is underexplored. The present study investigates the effect of graded readers, literature circles (LCs) and reading strategies on university students in Taiwan. Design/Methodology: This study adopted a quasi-experimental design with 60 first-year students reading two graded readers from the Oxford Bookworms collections. Of the 60 participants, 30 were in the control group and the other 30 who received the LC intervention were in the experimental group. Reading comprehension tests and a questionnaire for reading strategies were adopted. Findings: The findings revealed that the students with the LC intervention outperformed the control group. The tasks in the LC were found to promote reading comprehension and strategy practice. In general, though reading strategies were similarly adopted, monitoring strategies were more frequently used by the experimental group. Originality/Value: LCs offered EFL learners a way to build linguistic and cultural schemata, to develop and practice metacognitive reading strategies, to enhance main-idea comprehension, and to form long-term memories for retention.},

The discussion explores research approaches, contexts, methodologies, findings, trends and issues in peer-reviewed research that has investigated the use of this type of digital game over the period 2005 to 2020. Results showed that in a majority of studies, a simulation game was implemented in an experimental project. In terms of research context, most studies were carried out in universities in North America and EFL students were the most common participants. Most studies involved the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The majority of studies investigated vocabulary learning and data indicates that playing this type of game may enhance L2 vocabulary knowledge and retention. In addition, positive findings relating to affective factors are reported across the majority of projects. Analysis reveals that research is focused primarily on the above areas and that other aspects of learning remain under researched. It was also found that studies are subject to significant limitations. As findings from the current body of research are not conclusive, more work appears needed in order to clarify if simulation games represent an effective means to enhance learning outcomes. The discussion concludes by identifying areas of interest for investigation in future research and practice.},

	abstract = {Most Higher Education Institutions, including in Indonesia, must adopt and utilize online technologies for emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep the pedagogical practice running. Having done the practice for about one year, there is paramount to understand teachers' experience in adopting technologies. Arguably, there has been zero study employing narrative frames conducted in Indonesia investigating EFL (English as a foreign language) university teachers' experience in adopting online technologies for their teaching during the pandemic. Therefore, the present narrative study examines this issue. Four narrative frames were developed as the instruments of the study by referring to two core variables and one outcome variable of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) consisting of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and reported general use of online technologies. Sixteen narrative frames completed by participants from seven universities in East and West Java unveil that despite the arduous initial process of shifting from face-to-face into online teaching, problems and difficulties which were still encountered during the pedagogical undertaking and a somewhat limited number of online platforms that had been utilized, the teachers' very positive perceptions on the usefulness of online technologies led to persistence and optimism in their reported general use of the technologies in their teaching. It was concluded that teachers are quite ready to further implement online technologies in their teaching. However, supporting facilities, facilitating conditions, as well as training for developing technological knowledge and skills are needed to support the process.},

The present study aims to examine the association between writing instructional approaches and student writing motivation and engagement in the Chinese EFL context, and investigate the mediating role of writing feedback in this relationship. 2,169 students from 35 secondary schools in mainland China participated in this study. Results showed that product-oriented teaching approach related positively to the three indicators of maladaptive motivation (i.e., anxiety, failure avoidance, and uncertain control) and process-oriented teaching approach related positively to the two indicators of adaptive engagement (i.e., task management, persistence). While genre-oriented teaching approach related positively to adaptive motivation and engagement, and related negatively to maladaptive motivation and engagement, cooperative multimedia writing teaching approach related negatively to adaptive motivation and one factor of adaptive engagement (i.e., task management), and related positively to two factors of maladaptive motivation (i.e., anxiety, failure avoidance) and maladaptive engagement. This study also identified the mediating role of four feedback practices (i.e., learning-oriented feedback, expressive feedback, computer-mediated feedback, and peer and self feedback) in the associations between writing instructional approaches and student writing motivation and engagement. This study provides insights into our understanding of the complex relationship among teachers' instruction, classroom feedback practices, and student writing motivation and engagement in L2 school contexts.},

Moreover, the mode of the instruction (i.e., teacher instruction or game-based instruction) has also been undervalued. To address these gaps in the research literature, Taiwanese university student participants (n = 45) were randomly and equally divided into two experimental and one control group: teacher instruction with error correction; digital game-based instruction with error correction; and error correction only. Participants were asked to write three letters of application to three similar job advertisements as a pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest. Gain score results in the immediate posttest showed that the teacher instruction with error correction group significantly outperformed the error correction only group whereas gains in the delayed posttest showed the teacher instruction with error correction and the digital game-based instruction with error correction groups significantly outperformed the error correction only group. Results indicate that pedagogical practices that provide focused grammatical instruction with direct focused feedback are more beneficial to L2 writers than only providing error correction. Furthermore, the just-in-time grammar feedback provided during game play afforded learners with opportunities to engage in awareness-raising language related episodes. Such game play combined with written corrective feedback resulted in stronger retention of grammatical knowledge compared to learners that received teacher instruction combined with written corrective feedback.},

The study uses one measure of rater severity and two measures of rater consistency. The results suggest that the rating characteristics of individual raters are not stable. Thus, predictions from one administration to the next are difficult, although not impossible. In fact, as the membership of the group of raters changes from year to year, past data on rating characteristics become less useful. When the membership of the group of raters is retained, the community of raters develops more stable characteristics. However, "cultural shocks" (low retention of raters and large numbers of newcomers) destabilize the rating characteristics of the community and predictions become more difficult. We propose practical measures to increase the stability of rating across time and offer methodological suggestions for more efficient rater effect-related research designs and analyses.},

	abstract = {Phonesthesia is one of the counterexamples of the arbitrariness of human languages. Although an individual word still appears arbitrary, a group of words bearing the same sound pattern might share similar meaning. This study investigated phonesthesia as a route to improving word acquisition. First, by comparing the guessing accuracy of phonesthemic versus prosaic words, we found phonesthemic words were significantly guessed better, suggesting EFL learners' sensitivity to English phonesthemes prior to explicit instruction. Phonesthemes provide hints for learners trying to ascertain the meaning of an unknown word. However, according to the participants' self-report, such sensitivity seems to lie somewhere in between pure clang association and genuine phonesthemic association. In another experiment, we examined the effect of phonesthemic knowledge, induced by explicit instruction, on the retention of phonesthemic words. The experimental group was taught 12 English phonesthemes while the control group was not. It was revealed that learners equipped with phonesthemic knowledge could retain phonesthemic words significantly better over an interval. We argue this is due to an extension of the lexical network in learners' minds. The second experiment further verified the facilitative role of phonesthemes in word retention. It is recommended that EFL teachers raise learners' attention to phonesthesia, which may potentially assist in word learning.},

However, the author of this article could find no study that explores the prevalence of “native‐speakerism” and other forms of discrimination in English language teacher recruitment in South America. The current study thus investigated the extent to which online postings for English language teachers in Colombia expressed a preference for native‐English‐speaking teachers (NESTs) and how this discrimination intersects with other inequitable hiring practices. The author conducted content analysis on job ads found on two prominent Facebook groups for English language teachers in Colombia. The findings reveal evidence of discrimination in nearly half of the 95 job ads analysed. These ads discriminate based on age, gender, nationality, variety of English, the location where a prospective teacher gained their qualifications, and “nativeness.” The study tentatively concludes that this discrimination has several dimensions, with those further from the colonial “centre” facing greater degrees of discrimination. The mutually reinforcing constructs of coloniality and native‐speakerism help account for the persistence of such discrimination, which is also reflected in the Colombian governments’ linguistic policies.},

	abstract = {In the educational setting of Iran, language assessment literacy (LAL) is still an underexplored issue. This paper investigated the development of LAL among EFL students taking language assessment course at state universities in Iran. The three components of LAL (i.e., knowledge, skills, and principles) were the focus of the inquiry. To collect the required data, a questionnaire, encompassing 83 Likert items and a set of open-ended questions, was developed, and responses from 92 course instructors were collected. Teaching and assessment practices of two course instructors were also observed throughout an educational semester. SPSS (26) was used to analyze the data. Findings revealed that these courses mainly focused on knowledge and skills, overlooking the principles of assessment. Adherence to traditional assessment approaches, use of inappropriate teaching materials, and lack of practical works in assessment also characterized the investigated courses. The paper concludes with suggestions to better design language assessment courses to increase the assessment literacy of English graduates who will probably enter the teaching contexts after graduation.},

	abstract = {We investigated whether learning and retaining vocabulary in a second language (L2) can be improved by leveraging a combination of memory enhancement techniques. Specifically, we tested whether combining retrieval practice, spacing, and related manipulations in a 'multidomain' pedagogical approach enhances vocabulary acquisition as compared to a typical learning approach. In a classroom-laboratory design, 48 Turkish university students studying L2 English were trained on 64 English words over 17 days. They were assigned to either a 'typical' study regimen of (re)studying the words on the first day (initial study) and last day (cramming) of training, or an 'optimized' regimen of retrieval practice (retrieving the words), moreover with feedback, spaced throughout the period, moreover with expanding gaps. The target words were tested before training (pre-test) and one and 11 days afterwards (post-tests). Mixed-effects modeling revealed a training-group by test-session interaction, due to greater improvements from optimized training (a striking 18 percentage-point accuracy increase from pre-test to both post-tests) than typical training (an 8 percentage-point increase). Further analyses showed that the optimized training advantages were mainly driven by high (rather than low) frequency words. Overall, the results suggest that a multidomain approach of combining different memory enhancement techniques can lead to substantial gains in both the learning and retention of L2 words, as compared to a typical study pattern. The findings have implications for L2 learning and pedagogy.},

To increase the number of new second language teachers who remain in the profession, and to promote their use of best teaching practices, the ACTFL has identified mentoring as a national research priority. The importance of mentoring is further reflected in the new national standards established by the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) for teacher education programs. To address CAEP standards for advanced licensure programs and meet the needs of new second language teachers, a peer mentoring project was initiated. Using a mixed methodology, the researchers investigated the perceived benefits of a partnership between 27 mentors in an advanced licensure second language teaching program and 27 mentees, many of whom were practicing 'lateral entry' second language teachers who had not yet completed second language teacher training. The results suggested that, when both parties shared content area expertise and worked together in a nonjudgmental, supportive manner, the partnership was mutually beneficial. The results also suggested that the relationship can be facilitated when both partners share certain commonalities, including age and amount of previous teaching experience.},

	abstract = {Pronunciation instruction has historically been notorious for its intense reliance on repetition practice and mechanical drilling across most foreign and second language settings. However, research indicates that form‐focused instruction can be substantially beneficial to the development of phonological skills (Saito, 2012). The current quasi‐experimental study builds on this strand of research by measuring the impact of focus on form (FonF) on English as a foreign language learners’ retention of English word stress patterns, drawing mainly upon the so‐called macro‐options introduced by Ellis (e.g., 2008). Eight intact classes (N = 129), randomly assigned to four groups (output, input‐enhancement, corrective feedback, and control) were subjected to a series of mini‐lessons orchestrated by the researchers over an 8‐week period. The learners’ short‐ and long‐term phonological uptake was assessed by immediate and delayed word‐reading tests, respectively. The results indicate that the output‐oriented group outperformed the others on the immediate posttest, whereas the input‐enhancement group outdid the corrective feedback group. However, none of the three FonF options had a significant durable impact. The findings imply that production‐based instruction must be given a high priority in the domain of teaching suprasegmental features, not least lexical stress. Furthermore, phonologically overloading learners during each instructional period is not recommended.},

Forty-nine university students participated in a quasi-experimental design comparing two learning conditions: massed repetition and spaced repetition. Participants were taught the pronunciation of 40 new English words containing the target sounds through video-based instruction. The experiment utilized a within-subjects design, where each participant in both the control and experimental groups was exposed to a total of 40 words: 20 words taught using massed repetition and 20 words taught using spaced repetition. Pronunciation performance was assessed through tests administered immediately after the treatment (Time 1) and after 4 weeks post-treatment (Time 2). The study also explored the interaction between repetition type and input variability by incorporating High Variability Phonetic Training and Low Variability Phonetic Training conditions. Results revealed significant differences between spaced and massed repetition, with spaced repetition showing superior outcomes in both immediate and delayed tests. The study revealed no significant differences were found between High Variability Phonetic Training and Low Variability Phonetic Training conditions. These findings contribute to our understanding of effective pronunciation training methods in EFL contexts and highlight the importance of distributed practice in language learning.},

They were asked to fill in the missing verb in ten V + N target collocations embedded in sentences. A screen recorder was used to keep track of the students' lookup behaviour in the two conditions involving dictionary use such as every input of the searched word, every move and click of the mouse, every step of collocation search and the time length of dictionary consultation. After completion of the assignment all the students were given corrective feedback to the collocation task and marked their corrections on the test paper. Two weeks later, an unexpected retention test was administered. The study showed that dictionary use following a five-step training session reaped significantly more collocation gains than dictionary use without prior instruction and explicit collocation teaching. Compared with those who used the dictionary without prior training, the students with prior dictionary instruction employed more effective strategies concerning the selection of lookup words and the location and identification of collocation information. They took a more conscientious approach to dictionary use and retrieved more correct target verbs. Apart from lending new support to the continuous appeal for a position of dictionary use instruction in the EFL pedagogy, the study also provides a detailed demonstration of task-based dictionary training applicable to classroom practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Behavioural intention (BI) has been predicted using other variables by adopting the technology acceptance model (TAM). However, few studies have examined whether BI can predict learning performance. Objectives: The present study used an extended TAM to investigate whether students' BI is a predictor of their listening learning performance (LLP) through vocabulary learning performance (VLP) in the context of mobile vocabulary‐assisted listening learning by using two mobile learning tools. Methods: A total of 129 college students with a pre‐intermediate level of English were recruited as participants, and a 10‐week mobile vocabulary‐assisted, listening‐learning course was conducted in 2022. In each task of this course, the students had to learn target words from a listening passage on Quizlet and then engage in listening activities on Randall's ESL Cyber Listening Lab. Quantitative responses obtained through an online questionnaire were analysed through partial‐least‐squares structural equation modelling. Results: The analysis results indicated that BI significantly predicted LLP through VLP. Perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness (PU) were significant antecedents of BI. However, PEU did not significantly predict PU because of the difficulty of navigating between the two technological tools used in this study. The extended model demonstrated its effectiveness in explaining listening learning performance, as evidenced by an explained variance (R2) of 69\%. Conclusion: The extended model validates the influence of BI on learning performance and it can also draw teachers' focus toward the significance of enhancing students' BI to improve their listening learning performance. Pedagogical implications based on the results are provided in this paper. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: TAM was used to study learners' acceptance of mobile‐assisted language learning.TAM incorporates latent variables to explore mobile‐assisted language learning.Investigating factors influencing BI is a primary research focus in extended TAM literature.Mobile tools could improve listening learning and vocabulary retention. What this paper adds to that: Learning performance was considered as a dependent variable in an extended TAM.BI might predict students' learning performance in vocabulary and listening in an extended TAM.Teachers used two mobile tools to design mobile vocabulary‐assisted listening tasks.Pre‐learning the target words facilitate students' listening learning performance. Implications for practice and/or policy: We show the importance of BI on predicting listening learning performance.The impact of BI on other factors became another focus of TAM research.Results highlight pre‐learning target words' importance for better listening performance.Existing mobile tools improve listening performance, avoiding new system development.},

Moreover, a delayed posttest was scheduled at a retention interval (RI) of 4 and 28 days for the intensive group and spaced group respectively (considering an ISI/RI ratio of 25\%).

This impetus is largely driven by the increasing acknowledgement of daily communications as translingual practice. In fact, the closely related construct of plurilingualism has been incorporated into the development of the companion volume of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Council of Europe. 2020. Common European framework of reference for languages: Learning, teaching, assessment – Companion volume. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing. Available at: www.coe.int/lang-cefr). Despite the rising awareness towards translanguaging and plurilingualism in European and Northern American contexts (cf. Vallejo, Claudia \&amp; Melinda Dooly. 2020. Plurilingualism and translanguaging: Emergent approaches and shared concerns. Introduction to the special issue. International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism 23(1). 1–16), scepticism remains, especially in classroom settings. Through detailed analyses of extracts taken from 27 h of recordings of UK university ESL classroom interactions among Taiwanese L1 Mandarin students transcribed based on Jefferson (Jefferson, Gail. 2004. Glossary of transcript symbols with an introduction. In Gene Lerner (ed.), Conversation analysis: Studies from the first generation, 14–31. Philadelphia: John Benjamins) and supplemented by Matsumoto (Matsumoto, Yumi. 2019. Material moments: Teacher and student use of materials in multilingual writing classroom interactions.

Social Semiotics 27(4). 411–433), we aim to demonstrate the complementarity effect of various multimodal resources in progressing classroom instructions. Our analyses reveal that the different linguistic and non-linguistic resources deployed contribute to scaffolding and the development of a layered understanding of the concept in discussion (e.g. phrasal verbs). We argue that the translanguaging space enables students to engage in deeper learning. Students are empowered to break down the rigid power structure and actively participate in knowledge co-construction. We end our paper by calling for research that bridges current understanding of translanguaging and policy and assessment strategies development.},

To this end, a total number of 1968 Chinese EFL learners participated in this questionnaire survey. The results of the study showed that EFL teachers' affective scaffolding positively and significantly predicted students' academic engagement and psychological well-being. More specifically, it was found that teachers' affective scaffolding explained about 73\% and 65\% of variances in EFL students' academic engagement and psychological well-being. Moreover, it was found that psychological well-being and academic engagement were positively correlated and predicted 56\% of each other's variances. In accordance with these findings, educators are recommended to build up a harmonious teacher-student relationship to foster students' psych-emotional development.},

	abstract = {This paper examines whether a web-based training on English discourse intonation leads to better spontaneous speech quality for Mandarin Chinese speakers who reside in the U.S. and in China. The four-week fully online training consisted of meta-instruction videos as well as listening and speaking activities, including instant visual pitch contour feedback and individualized evaluation. The students gave a one-minute spontaneous speech on a given topic at the beginning and the end of the study via videoconferencing. Four native English speakers judged the students' speech comprehensibility, fluidity, accent, confidence and attractiveness, in addition to their intonation performance. Two-way ANCOVA test results show that the experimental group made statistically significant improvement in their speech comprehensibility and speaking confidence. In contrast, the control group did not show improvement. The participants' residence in the U.S. or in China did not affect the training effects. There was not an interaction between the participants' residence and the training. The web-based training, visualization and CMC technology provided an effective scaffolding experience and benefited both EFL and ESL students equally. This study also explores Chinese students' challenges with specific intonation features based on both the raters' judgments and the learners' self-evaluations. The results suggest they have more difficulties with thought groups and prominence than with tone choices. While the trainees gave high ratings to all the activities, they preferred individualized evaluation from the researcher to self-created visual feedback using Praat. The findings have implications for Chinese L1-specific intonation instruction and developing web-based computer assisted pronunciation training systems.},

	abstract = {Background study: Although the number of computer‐based instruction has increased drastically, the understanding of how design features of learning modality can affect learning remains incompelte. This partly stems from studies' heavy focus on modified output. Therefore, how interactive nature of computer‐mediated learning feeds into learning is under examined. Objectives: This study examined the potentials of multimodal and text‐based computer‐mediated communication (CMC) to support learner communication repair, co‐regulation patterns and engagement dimensions. Method: To this end, collaborative online writing performance of 30 English as a Foreign Language learners in Moodle and online writing forum was analysed via conversation analysis. Data from stored conversation of Moodle and chat logs of writing forum were coded for communication repair to trace language related episodes (LREs), co‐regulation patterns and students' engagement dimensions. Results: The frequency analysis of coded data on LREs indicated while multimodal CMC involved students in global and organisational and content LREs, text‐based computer‐mediate communication involved students in morphosyntactic and lexical LREs. Results also indicated significant differences in co‐regulation patterns in multimodal and text‐based computer‐mediated communication. While students enacted planning, monitoring co‐regulation practices in multimodal computer‐mediated communication, students in text‐based CMC executed evaluation and elaboration co‐regulation practices. Findings also indicated that students were differentially engaged in learning. Students were more emotionally and socially engaged in multimodal CMC and cognitively and behaviourally engaged in text‐based computer‐mediated writing. Conclusions: The results posit dual function for CMCs, as a mean for communication and cognitive co‐regulation. However, dynamics of interaction is influenced by the mode of interaction. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Computer‐mediated communications (CMCs) in education reveal significant variability in research on online educational spaces, making it challenging to provide a definitive answer regarding CMC efficacy.The variation in cognitive processing across modalities can impact memory and perceptions of content and news stories.The existing literature reveals tendency predominantly centres on easily observable aspects such as student achievement within online learning spaces, while neglecting the documentation of students' personalised strategies for regulating their learning, improving communication repair, and fostering overall engagement with the learning process (Mohammadi Zenouzagh et al., 2023). What this paper adds: Current efforts often apply established mediated communication principles to digital discourse without recognising the unique affordances of digital modalities and their impact on learner outcomes and interaction.The research makes significant contributions by addressing the limited exploration of technology‐enhanced curriculum in mediating students' communication and negotiation repair, offering insights into the diverse potentials of e‐learning environments.Additionally, it provides valuable perspectives on how different e‐learning modalities can engage students in varied co‐regulation patterns.Notably, the study employs an emic perspective through conversation analysis, avoiding reliance on questionnaires and self‐reports susceptible to reliability and social desirability issues. Implications for practice and/or policy: Our study's results propose a dual role for social interaction, serving both as a means of communication and as a cognitive mechanism for co‐regulation in co‐regulated learning, which is deemed essential for L2 development.The results imply that teaching professionals must make principled considerations about which CMC medium to use and choose based on priorities of outcome, patterns of co‐student management and regulations, and student engagement dimension in main, complementary, and remedial curricula.The findings of the study suggest that development of interactional practices is variant with respect to the learning context. Instructional designs that maxim learning opportunities through establishment of learning context that sponsors co‐regulated learning is essential. Interactional features of CMCs and their structural affordances can help teachers to make decisions that best fit their instructional purposes. Learning environments that embrace technological interfaces, provide resources, enable peer interaction, and include a variety of means to create communities that can foster knowledge construction are highly valuable.The practical implications drawn from the findings suggest that teachers should consider the choice between text‐based and multimodal CMC based on specific instructional needs. Text‐based CMC is advantageous when real‐time, on‐task learner engagement is a priority, as it tends to more effectively involve learners in actual performance. In contrast, multimodal CMC is valuable when scaffolding through emotional engagement and collaboration is required. Multimodal CMC offers benefits such as richer communication cues, instant feedback, and the use of natural language.},

Adopting conversation analysis as an analytical framework, it aims to extend our understanding of the use of learner-initiated translanguaging and teacher responsiveness to translanguaging as an important interactional resource for learners to achieve interactional goals. The study identifies eight facilitative uses of L1. On the one hand, these uses contribute to the progressivity of talk as self-addressed translanguaging. On the other, they support intersubjectivity as co-constructed translanguaging in L2 interaction. These uses include (1) connectives for topic management; (2) floor-holding devices; (3) explicit word searches; (4) lexical gap fillers; (5) understanding displays; (6) clarification requests; (7) confirmation checks; and (8) explicit request for assistance. The study also reveals that learners' self-initiated repair using L1 was frequently observed and that its use was intertwined with translanguaging in its functionality in discourse for meaning-making as a discursive practice. This study suggests that the use of translanguaging in the L2 classroom can be an indispensable tool to optimise learners' classroom interactional competence.},

While studies on peer feedback proliferate, little is known about whether and how peer feedback is affected by learners' motivational levels. Objectives: Situated in a mobile collaborative learning context, the current study examined how English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students with different motivational levels participated in mobile‐assisted peer feedback provision, as well as the characteristics of the feedback they provided. Methods: A total of 61 sophomores majoring in Business English at a Chinese university participated in this 16‐week‐long study. They were asked to complete oral assignments and give and receive peer feedback via MosoTeach (a popular mobile learning application in China). Multiple types of data (peer feedback records, questionnaires, reflective journals and interviews) were collected, analysed, and triangulated. Results and Conclusions: Results revealed that EFL learners with higher motivation were more likely to provide feedback on time using more words. Unique characteristics of mobile‐assisted peer feedback among highly motivated learners were also observed. Implications: The study highlights the importance of learner motivation in mobile‐assisted peer feedback practice and provides pedagogical suggestions for better designing and implementing peer feedback in mobile collaborative learning contexts.

The focus of the study was on the process rather than the product of learning, with the aim of gaining insights into the diagnostic nature of DA to address persistent problems these learners had been shown to have, as confirmed by their instructor. Data were collected via individualized sessions between the mediator and the learners, randomly assigned into interaction-ist (n=3) and interventionist (n=2) DA groups. Qualitative analysis of transcribed interactions evidenced that interactionist DA could provide more nuanced understandings of the learners' ZPDs in relation to the components of Toulmin's model.

A set of tests was utilized to examine learners' grammatical awareness and their perception of six major grammatical items--tense, prepositions, articles, voices, morphology, and vocabulary. The results demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the scores of tense, article, and voice for grammatical awareness between the high-level and the low-level group. Also, both groups scored high for the category of voice while they received low scores for vocabulary and morphology. In addition, they showed a significant difference in the scores for the perceived difficulty of articles and voice. The high-level group perceived voice as the most difficult, whereas the low-level group perceived articles as the most difficult. These findings demonstrate a gap between the learners' grammar awareness and perception and highlight a need to design an individualized curriculum for the effectiveness of teaching as well as self-initiated studying.},

These conversation practices were categorized into ‘designed talk’ and ‘free talk’, based on the content of an English textbook and authentic ambient environment that includes such things as transportation, weather and scenic descriptions, respectively. The mechanisms in Smart UEnglish were designed in consideration of flexible, sustainable and adaptive conversations to improve English-speaking and lexical resources. Statistical analysis results show that the learning achievement of the experimental group is significantly higher than that of the control group. Moreover, both ‘designed talk’ and ‘free talk’ have significant positive correlations with learning achievement. Further analysis with stepwise multiple regression found that ‘designed talk’ plays the most important role and can significantly influence learning achievement. This is because ‘designed talk’ can motivate them to practice what they learned in class during their daily conversations and consolidate the understanding and applying of English vocabularies and sentence patterns through ‘designed talk’. According to interview records, participants also perceived that using Smart UEnglish for conversation practice in authentic contexts can stimulate their interests and ideas to think and practice more useful English conversation. Hence, Smart UEnglish can effectively help English-speaking and conversation in authentic contexts anytime and anywhere.},

The results showed that for the unsuccessful dyad, silence, which was used by the Japanese EFL learner as a contextualization cue, triggered the American student's hyperexplanation to get the Japanese partner involved in conversation. However, such a high-involvement strategy, only resulted in producing fewer opportunities for the Japanese partner to contribute to the conversation (i.e. vicious cycle). In contrast, successful turn negotiation of the other dyad enabled them to share knowledge schema, improve recipient design, and adjust their speech accordingly. Such personalized speech, in turn, led to the co-construction of conversation (i.e. virtuous cycle). Based on these observations, I conclude that 'missed communication' may entrench attribution of negative personal traits unless appropriate scaffolding/intervention is provided. 本研究では、日米間のビデオ会話に参加した二組の外国語学習者のターンテイキングの様式を比較分析した。会話構築に成功したペアが友情を深め、授業履修後も連絡を取り合ったのに対し、もう一組のペアは教師の介入が必要な程、会話に支障をきたした。「会話スタイル」の枠組みを用いてこの二組の英会話時におけるターン構築を分析することで、プロジェクトの成功・失敗の要因を探った。談話分析の結果、日本人英語学習者により言語援助要求の合図として使われた沈黙が、アメリカ人英語母国語話者の過剰説明を引き起こしていたことがわかった。このhigh-involvementストラテジーが日本人英語学習者の会話貢献の機会を少なくしたため、更にターンの悪循環が起きた。一方、成功したペアの会話は、知識スキーマの共有、受け手志向性の改良などによって、協力的な会話構築がなされていた。聞き手の外国語能力に合った発話は会話を促し、それがターンの好循環に繋がった。これらの結果から、異文化間のミスコミュニケーションが起こった際、教室内外で適切なスキャフォールディングが行われなければ、会話参加者の否定的な感情を増強させてしまう可能性があることを示した。},

We used the performance data from 3,358 students' item-level responses to a field test of a national EFL test primarily intended for tertiary-level EFL learners. The results showed that proficiency classifications and subskill mastery classifications were generally of acceptable reliability, and the two kinds of classifications were in alignment with each other at individual and group levels. The outcome of the study is a set of descriptors that describe each test taker's ability to understand certain level of oral texts and his or her cognitive performance. The current study, by illustrating the feasibility of combining standard setting and CDA approaches to produce individualized feedback, contributes to the enhancement of score reporting and addresses the long-standing criticism that large-scale language assessments fail to provide individualized feedback to link assessment with instruction.},

This study reports on research, examining engagement in Initiation, Response, and Feedback moves in the IRF cycles. Video recordings and questionnaires were used to collect data from ten EFL classes, being directed by eight teachers, with 73 learners. Using a post-interaction questionnaire and conversation analysis of classroom interactions, the analysis of the data revealed 784 triadic cycles out of which 493 moves embodied engagement. The data showed that not only do the Response and Feedback stages afford L2 learners the opportunity to deliberate on Form-focused language-related episodes (F-LREs), Lexis-focused LREs (L-LREs), and Mechanical LREs (M-LREs), but they also promote social and affective engagement. The comments on the questionnaire also revealed a deeper understanding of the participants' affective engagement. The findings revealed that certain features of the IRF cycles and peers' contributions encourage engagement during the IRF cycles. The results also demonstrated that scaffolding, mutuality, reciprocity, back-channeling, and commenting on preceding contributions made L2 learners socially engaged. The analysis suggests that the IRF cycles can create ad-hoc chances for engagement in L2 classroom interactions.},

Whenever EFL learners and EFL teachers work in a classroom environment, they practice input-output processing of target a language. Their mutual engagement and exchange lead students to involve in a communicative act that resembles communication in a real-life situation. This research paper assesses Classroom Talk (CT) and how it is connected with Teacher Talking Time (TTT) and Student Talking Time (STT). Observation, transcribing, and survey have been used as the research tools to collect the data. This research paper transcribes 4 listening-and-speaking classes of two groups of the students, surveys 7 EFL teachers and incorporates the researchers' own observation to investigate the interplay between students' talk and teacher's talk and evaluates classroom talk as a supportive tool (scaffold) to improve teaching and learning process in a foreign language classroom. The paper finds that classroom talk is a significant input to evaluate the classroom learning environment. How much language output students produce, what level of language proficiency they exhibit and how much it represents CLT features suggest pedagogical implication for scaffolding EFL learning in the classroom.},

	abstract = {While previous studies have examined the impact of digital multimodal composing (DMC) as a new literacy activity on second language (L2) learners' language development, L2 teachers' engagement with DMC is under-conceptualized and underexplored. Based on a qualitative analysis of five teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL) who implemented in their curriculum a year-long DMC program within which students produced multimodal videos, this study presents three forms of teacher engagement with DMC. In the first form, the teachers used DMC as an instrument for traditional exercises of speaking and writing with incidental attention to the multimodal aspects of DMC, while in the second, the teachers manifested ambivalence about the means and the ends of using DMC. The teacher in the third form used DMC as integral to pedagogy with attention to not only students' language use, but also strategic use of multiple resources. These results suggest that teacher engagement with DMC can be conceptualized as a multifaceted continuum. The findings also reveal that these individualized engagements were directed by teachers' conceptions of themselves, students, and language and mediated by contextual factors associated with the prescribed curriculum and high-stakes testing regimes. The paper concludes with implications regarding ways to promote teacher engagement with DMC in digitalized instructional landscapes.},

Quantitative and qualitative data were collected over two semesters with monologue tasks and semi‐structured interviews, respectively. Oral fluency development was examined using moving min–max graphs, change point analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, while the retrodiction approach was utilized to identify influential motivational attractor states. Results showed that, over the course of the study, the two learners experienced distinct variability and phase shifts in their development of oral fluency, largely attributable to their unique motivational attractor states. By employing such a dual‐focus approach, the present study provided a nuanced picture of Chinese EFL learners' developmental dynamics in terms of both oral fluency and learning motivation and the adaptive interactions between them, thus enriching our understanding of how oral fluency development relates to learner motivation.},

The present study aims to examine the differential effects of two modes of fully online flipped instruction, i.e. interaction-embedded (IE) and interaction-reduced (IR), on EFL learners’ speaking. Aligning with a quasi-experimental design, the current study recruited 43 intermediate learners from an English language institute, comprising an experimental group (n = 22) which received an interaction-embedded online flipped instruction with a student-centered teaching style (hereafter IE group) and a comparison group (n = 21) which underwent an interaction-reduced online flipped instruction following a teacher-dominated mode of teaching (hereafter IR group). The participants were selected from intact classes following a convenience sampling method and homogenized based on the Oxford Placement Test (OPT) scores. The results of Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests indicated that IE and IR modes of online flipped instruction both affected the students’ speaking significantly. Further analysis confirmed the superiority of the IE group to the IR group; however, the observed effect size was negligible. The qualitative findings from semi-structured interviews revealed that the fully online flipped classes secure an innovative, effective and collaborative learning that helps overcome the disorientation problems and apprehension of synchronous live interactions. As such, we posit the significance of online flipped instruction as an approach that bolsters computer-mediated, collaborative speaking and collective scaffolding through establishing an online learning community.},

This article investigated the impact of motivational scaffolds on a group of Iranian EFL learners' individual and socially-shared metacognition. Two groups of 30 female intermediate learners participated in this study. In the experimental group, the participants received the teacher's motivational scaffolds as she provided instructions and feedback throughout individual and collaborative oral and written tasks. On the other hand, the participants in the control group were asked to take part in the routine oral and written classroom activities. The participants' think-aloud protocols in individual and pair activities were analyzed, and instances of metacognitive activities were identified. The data were analyzed through two Mann-Whitney U tests, and the results indicated that motivational scaffolds statistically significantly enhanced the use of metacognitive strategies at both inter and intra-individual levels.

The study is based on the assumption that theatre will facilitate and enhance language learning especially when learners hail from a rich L1 theatrical culture. The thesis therefore aimed to find out whether theatre could be used to promote oral and written communication skills and whether it would encourage community learning in groups and create a healthy collaborative learning atmosphere in order to open up possibilities for extending the scope of traditional classroom teaching and learning. Being exploratory and essentially ethnographic in nature, the research methods used in the investigation were participant observation and open-ended interactions with students accompanied by researcher intervention and teaching. The texts that were analysed included classroom scripts, students' and teacher's diaries, the workshop journal of the researcher and comments from parents and well-wishers. The theoretical framework of the thesis draws on the uses of theatre in education and language learning, the notion of a scaffolding device and concepts of dialogic and liberating pedagogy. The initial investigation in the form of a preliminary study paved the way for the main study and indicated the need for a longitudinal ethnographic oriented main study. This was carried out over a period of three months with secondary level Sri Lankan Tamil students transiting into English medium of instruction. The findings reveal that the use of theatre promotes learning in a substantial manner. Students were able to create situations, enact scenes and then script plays, thus producing the necessary language for communication in those contexts. Their spontaneous and effective oral communicative capability which the theatre workshop enhanced was reflected in the performances that preceded the group-wise scripting and the enhancing of the written capability was captured in the scripts and diary entries.},

The analysis showed that the TRO experienced a gradually integrated and transformed path of concept development, and also initiated an expansive learning opportunity for her research participants, triggering collective concept development.

Recently, researchers proposed that students' reasons underlying their performance-approach goals may further our understanding of the nature of these goals (goal complexes). With a sequential explanatory mixed-method approach, we examined the function of performance-approach goal complexes on students' L2 self-efficacy and anxiety, by surveying 283 Chinese college EFL-learners and conducting semi-structured interviews with six purposefully-selected students. Quantitative analyses showed that our data partly supported the proposed mediation model. Students' controlled reasons to have performance-approach goals showed a significant direct effect on both their L2 anxiety (positively) and L2 self-efficacy (negatively). Conversely, students' autonomous reasons showed a positive effect on their L2 self-efficacy, and a negative effect on their L2 anxiety, indirectly through their performance-approach goals. Qualitative interviews provided further insights into the mechanism of the model. Pedagogical implications and directions for future studies are discussed.},

	abstract = {\&lt;bold\&gt;Background: \&lt;/bold\&gt;In 2013, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) recommended that all 126 countries using only oral polio vaccine (OPV) introduce at least 1 dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) into their routine immunization schedules by the end of 2015. In many countries, the addition of IPV would necessitate delivery of multiple injectable vaccines (hereafter, "multiple injections") during a single visit, with infants receiving IPV alongside pentavalent vaccine (which covers diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis; hepatitis B; and Haemophilus influenzae type b) and pneumococcal vaccine. Unanticipated concerns emerged from countries over acceptability of multiple injections, sites of administration, and safety. We contextualized the issues surrounding multiple injections by documenting concerns associated with administration of ≥3 injections, existing evidence in the published literature, and findings of a systematic review on administration practices and techniques.\&lt;bold\&gt;Methods: \&lt;/bold\&gt;Concerns associated with multiple-injection visits were documented from meetings and personal communications with immunization program managers. Published literature on the acceptability of multiple injections by providers and caregivers was summarized, and a systematic review of the literature on administration practices was completed on the following topics: spacing between injection sites (ie, vaccine spacing), site of injection, route of injection, and procedural preparedness. WHO and United Nations Children's Fund data from 2013-2015 were used to assess multiple-injection visits included in national immunization schedules.\&lt;bold\&gt;Results: \&lt;/bold\&gt;Healthcare provider and caregiver attitudes and practices indicated concerns about infant pain, potential adverse effects, and uncertainty about vaccine effectiveness with multiple-injection visits. Published literature reinforced the record of safety and acceptance of the recommended schedule of IPV by the SAGE, but the evidence was largely from developed countries. Parental acceptance of multiple injections was associated with a positive provider recommendation to the caregiver. Findings of the systematic review identified that the intramuscular route is preferred over the subcutaneous route for vaccine administration and that the vastus lateralis muscle is preferred over the deltoid muscle for intramuscular injections. Recommendations on vaccine spacing and procedural preparedness were based on practical necessities, but comparative evidence was not identified. During 2013-2015, 85 countries added IPV to their immunization schedules, 46 (55\%) of which adopted a schedule resulting in 3 injectable vaccines being administered in a single visit.\&lt;bold\&gt;Conclusion: \&lt;/bold\&gt;The multiple-injection experience identified gaps in guidance for future vaccine introductions. Global partner organizations quickly mobilized to assess, document, and communicate the existing global experience on multiple-injection visits. This evidence-based approach provided reassurance to opinion leaders, health workers, and professional societies, thus encouraging uptake of IPV as a second or third injection in an accelerated manner globally.},

The results yielded by a posttest involving new six‐frame cartoons indicated that blocked practice resulted in greater fluency development (faster articulation rate and shorter mid‐clause pause duration) than did interleaved practice. Moreover, the learners in the blocked‐practice group tended to pause more frequently at clause boundaries. Blocked practice also led to significantly longer mean length of run and higher phonation/time ratio during training, although this advantage failed to transfer to meaningful pretest–posttest changes. These dynamic fluency developmental patterns are discussed to elucidate the underlying proceduralization in L2 speech processes.},

A total of 90 freshmen participated in the experiment and were divided into three groups: the blocked repetition group, the interleaved repetition group, and a control group. This study adopted a pre- and post-test design. After the learners repetitively practiced the problem-solving tasks for three weeks, their improvement was measured by a new task of the same type. The analyses of speed, breakdown, and repair in learners' oral performance reported that the experimental groups outperformed the control group in fluency measurement. Specifically, the interleaved repetition group was advantageous compared with the blocked repetition group, except for the silent pause numbers. The findings not only support the interleaving effects and enrich the line of task repetition research but also have pedagogical implications in that introducing interleaved practice in real classrooms is beneficial to L2 speaking enhancement.},

The procedure included: a pre‐test, two repetition tasks with a 1‐week intersession interval (spaced practice group) or without an interval (massed practice group), and a post‐test. The grammatical complexity, grammatical accuracy, fluency, and lexical variety of learners' performances were examined using ANCOVA.

Participants underwent 3 training sessions followed by a final retention test. Results showed that the effects of ISI and RI differed depending on the type of knowledge to be retained. For the retention of declarative knowledge, RI had a robust effect: the longer the RI, the worse the retention. Compared to shorter spaced practice (1‐day ISI), longer spaced practice (1‐week ISI) seemed to improve long‐term retention (4‐week RI) of declarative knowledge; however, this ISI effect was much weaker. For procedural knowledge retention, ISI played an important role, but not RI, and it was the shorter spaced practice schedule that had an advantage over the longer spaced practice schedule.},

The specific considerations discussed include the interaction between intersession intervals and retention intervals, the manipulation of posttests as a between‐participants variable, the number of task repetitions, absolute versus relative spacing, the criterion of learning, task type versus exact task repetition, and blocked versus interleaved practice. Each of these considerations is discussed with links, as appropriate, to the relevant empirical input spacing and task repetition literature. The purpose of this review is to highlight how, in many cases, these methodological considerations have been overlooked by task repetition researchers, including in studies where input spacing has and has not been a direct focus, and to suggest ways of addressing these methodological shortcomings in future research.

	abstract = {Research has suggested that long spacing (i.e., temporal intervals) within a training session facilitates second language vocabulary learning. Studies, however, have been limited to treatment that involved sessions for only initial learning but not subsequent relearning. Furthermore, most studies have investigated only the benefits of spacing without considering its potential costs (i.e., increased duration of the treatment). In our study, we examined the benefits and costs of within‐session spacing for both initial learning and relearning. In this study, 170 Japanese‐speaking university students learned 20 English–Japanese word pairs using one of the following four combinations of initial and relearning spacing: long–long, long–short, short–long, and short–short spacing. The results showed that introducing long spacing for both initial learning and relearning (long–long) led to better long‐term retention and higher efficiency scores (i.e., number of words learned per trial) despite the increased duration of the treatment.

To address this concern, the participants in the current study completed a posttask questionnaire probing their perceptions toward task repetition practice, focusing on metacognitive judgment (i.e., the number of task repetitions considered effective) and emotional engagement (i.e., enjoyment and concentration). Prior to taking the survey, 64 second language learners individually performed the same picture‐description task six times under one of the three repetition schedules (massed, short‐spaced, and long‐spaced condition). Their posttask questionnaire results indicated that task repetition was perceived as an effective and engaging activity (about four to five performances were deemed to be most optimal). Relative to massed task repetition, short‐ and long‐spaced schedules led to higher perceived effectiveness and emotional engagement. Moreover, while the short‐spaced group made accurate metacognitive judgment of their fluency gains, learners in the massed practice condition overestimated their fluency gains, possibly due to enjoyment and illusion of high competence. These findings indicate that spacing between task repetitions can influence learners' engagement in the task, which can impact their fluency development.},

This degree of freedom is used to choose the valuesof the latter (their sum of squares is normalized to unity) so as tominimize the least squares difference \${\textbackslash}sum\_\{i=m+1\}{\textasciicircum}M {\textbar}f\_id(z\_i)-n(z\_i){\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2 \$ at the remaining \$M-m\$ pairs \$(z\_i,f\_i)\$.

Nakatsukasa, O. Sète and L.{\textasciitilde}N.Trefethen, op. cit.]. The name AAA means ``adaptive-Antoulas-Anderson'', inreference to a paper of A.{\textasciitilde}C. Antoulas and B.{\textasciitilde}D.{\textasciitilde}Q. (B.{\textasciitilde}D.{\textasciitilde}O.) Anderson [IMA J. Math. Control. Inform. \{{\textbackslash}bf 3\} (1986), no.{\textasciitilde}2-3, 61--88,{\textbackslash}doi\{10.1093/imamci/3.2-3.61\}]where a related algorithm wasproposed. It is essential that the poles of \$r(z)\$ are obtained fromthe zeros of \$d(z)\$ and thus are ``freely moving'', i.e., their positionis determined by the fitted data without any other restriction.{\textbackslash}par The paper under review starts with a discussion of the approximation byrationalfunctions of an analytic function \$f(z)\$ given on \$[-1,1]\$, placing itin contrast with the approximation by polynomials. For the latter, theposition of the ``closest'' singularity controls the possible rate ofconvergence of polynomials. If the smallest ellipse with foci at \$z={\textbackslash}pm1\$ and passing through the singularity has parameter (sum of thetwo half-axes) \${\textbackslash}rho\$, then there exist polynomials \$p\_n\$ approximating \$f\$on \$[-1,1]\$ like \$C{\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}\{-n\}\$; these polynomials converge to \$f(z)\$uniformly on compact sets inside the ellipse at an exponential rate.{\textbackslash}par No such estimates are possible for rational approximants with``moving'' poles; in principle, they may do much better, and offerextrapolations on extended regions, as illustrated in the paper by theAAA algorithm applied on several examples, either from data on the\$[-1,1]\$ interval on functions with nearby singularities (e.g., \${\textbackslash}tanh z\$) orattempting a numerical reconstruction of the Riemann \${\textbackslash}zeta\$function, starting from values at points along a complex segment or thereconstruction of conformal mappings starting from the mapping functionof the boundary. Sometimes the results are so impressive that one istempted to believe that analytic continuation poses no seriousproblems.{\textbackslash}par Section 5 of the paper hurries to destroy such illusions---althoughthe author tries to find the bright side of the destruction. He givesexamples of functions---analytic in a sizable neighborhood of the realaxis---which on large intervals of the real axis vanish to a machineprecision of 16 digits and then ``recover'' on other intervals tobecome unity also to this precision. Clearly, ``blind'' analyticextrapolation from machine-generated data on a finite interval cannotexclude a{\textasciitilde}priori such functions. Manipulating them, the authorshows how to produce analytic (machine-)interpolants between disjointpieces of analytic functions or other constructions which areimpossible at zero errors.{\textbackslash}parSection 6 is the ``heart'' of the approximation part of the paper: itgives a resumé of results of J.{\textasciitilde}L. Walsh [\{{\textbackslash}it Interpolation andapproximation by rational functions in the complex domain\}, fourth edition,Amer. Math. Soc. Colloq. Publ., Vol. XX, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI,1965 (Chapters VIII and IX); [msn] MR0218588 [/msn]]concerning rational approximation of holomorphic functions and theircontemporary presentation in the language of complex potential theory.The rational approximants \$r\_n(z)\$ have fixed poles \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}pi\_k{\textbackslash}\}\_\{k=1\}{\textasciicircum}n\$and are supposed to interpolate a function \$f(z)\$, holomorphic in adomain \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ at \$n\$ points \${\textbackslash}\{z\_k{\textbackslash}\}\_\{k=1\}{\textasciicircum}n\$, for definitenesssituated in \$E{\textbackslash}equiv{\textbackslash}vert-1,1{\textbackslash}vert\$. The remarkable conclusion is that,as \$n{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty\$, exponential convergence, i.e., \${\textbar}f(z)-r\_n(z){\textbar}=O({\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}n)\$, \${\textbackslash}alpha\&lt;1\$, \$z{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}Omega\$, may be achieved in alarge variety of reciprocal geometries of poles and interpolationpoints. The center of these developments is a celebrated manipulationof the Cauchy integral formula, the Hermite integral, that is, \$\$f(z)-r\_n(z)={\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2{\textbackslash}pii\}{\textbackslash}int\_\{{\textbackslash}Gamma\}{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}phi(z)\}\{{\textbackslash}phi(t)\}{\textbackslash}frac\{f(t)\}\{t-z\}dt,\$\$where \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ is a curve contained in \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ enclosing \$E\$ and justavoiding the poles \${\textbackslash}pi\_k\$, leaving them outside (see Figure 12 of the paper).The function \${\textbackslash}phi {\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}Pi\_k(z-z\_k)/(z-{\textbackslash}pi\_k)\$ is obviously smallfor \$z\$ near \$[-1,1]\$ and large near \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ so that the quantity\${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sup\_\{t{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}Gamma,z{\textbackslash}in E\}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}phi(z)/{\textbackslash}phi(t){\textbar}\$ is a measureof the approximation of the function \$f\$ by \$r\_n\$. Section 6 supports the ideathat the problem of minimizing \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ in the limit of large\$n\$ when poles are distributed on \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ with density \$d{\textbackslash}mu(t)\$ andinterpolation point fill up \$[-1,1]\$ with density \$d{\textbackslash}mu(z)\$ isequivalent to the problem of finding charge distributions, positive on\${\textbackslash}Gamma\$, negative on \$E\$ minimizing the electrostatic two-dimensionalenergy of the conductors \$E\$ and \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ with the constraint ofneutrality. The resulting extremal potential functions---solutions ofthe Laplace equation---are constant along the conductors, vanishing on\${\textbackslash}Gamma\$, negative on \$E\$ and allow placing bounds---showingexponential convergence---on the discrepancy \${\textbackslash}vert f(z) - r\_n(z){\textbackslash}vert\$at all points \$z\$ enclosed by \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ (Theorem 3 of the paper).{\textbackslash}par Section 7 explores the consequences of this result for approximationalong the interval \$E\$ embedded in various geometries, allowing the curve\${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ to consist of several components. The \$(E,{\textbackslash}Gamma)\$ pair is---inanalogy to electrostatics---a ``condenser'', endowed with a capacity\$\{{\textbackslash}rm cap\}(E,{\textbackslash}Gamma)\$, defined as the inverse of the extremal energy value,so that the convergence on the interpolation region \$E\$ is like\${\textbackslash}exp(-1/\{{\textbackslash}rm cap\}(E,{\textbackslash}Gamma))\$. The author shows that rational approximantsmay achieve even superexponential convergence (i.e., \$O({\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}n)\$ for\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ arbitrarily small) for meromorphic functions or (aspolynomials) for entire functions (Theorem 5).{\textbackslash}par A situation of special interest is that of functions with branchpoints. The curve \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ may enclose any choice of the cut starting(and ending) at branch points, but the convergence rate depends on thechoice; it turns out (Theorem 6) that an optimal choice exists, whichminimizes \$\{{\textbackslash}rm cap\}(E,{\textbackslash}Gamma)\$. In practice, poles and zeros of the rationalapproximant tend to arrange themselves along curves joining the branchpoints (Figures 17 and 18). A citation of a beautiful theorem of Gonchar andStahl about conditions for accelerated rates of convergence of rationalapproximants closes this section.{\textbackslash}par Section 8, entitled ``Analytic continuation beyond \$E\$'', makes clear thedifference between numerical analytic continuation, which starts fromdata affected with errors, and ``mathematical'' analytic continuation,which inquires about the convergence of, e.g., Padé approximantsobtained from a large finite number of \{{\textbackslash}it exact\} Taylor coefficientsas their number increases indefinitely (Theorem 8 of Nuttall and Pommerenke andTheorem 9 of Stahl). Statements on numerical analyticcontinuation are rather vague, descriptive and contain advice aboutwhat to do if the method of continuation does not produce what oneexpects (e.g., how to remove Froissart doublets).{\textbackslash}par Sections 9 and 10 contain a collection of applications of the AAAalgorithm to the analysis of solutions of several ordinary or partialdifferential equations with the intention to explore the underlyinganalytic structure. An algorithm similar to AAA for continuation in two(complex) dimensions does not appear to exist so far: the examplespresented in Section 10 as attempts at continuations in two realvariables are one-dimensional AAA continuations along families of linesor curves.{\textbackslash}par Upon considering these examples, the skeptical reader---stillunder the impression of the functions displayed in Section 5 (e.g., theinterpolant between \${\textbackslash}sin 20x\$ and (machine)zero, Figure 9)---wonders whythey do not ruin any attempt at analytic continuation (e.g., in Figure 9from the interval \$(1, 2)\$ to the left). These examples actually show thatany sort of analytic continuation from error-affected data on someinterval is bound to be highly ambiguous unless some restrictions areimposed to restore the continuity of the (inverse) linear operatorleading from function values on that interval to the function itself. Ageneral principle adopted in the literature on inverse problems isthat---roughly speaking---the restriction to a compact set in the space offunctions to be reconstructed achieves precisely this. This observation---dueto A.{\textasciitilde}N. Tikhonov [C. R. (Doklady) Acad. Sci. URSS (N.S.) \{{\textbackslash}bf 39\} (1943),176--179; [msn] MR0009685 [/msn]] (see also Chapter I, §2 in [A.{\textasciitilde}N. Tikhonov and V.{\textasciitilde}Y. Arsenin, \{{\textbackslash}it Méthodes de resolution deproblèmes mal posés\}, Mir, Moscow, 1976; [msn] MR0455367 [/msn]])---hasbeen applied, e.g., inanalytic continuation from the interval \$E\$ to the domain \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ in theform of a uniform bound on the sought holomorphic functions (see theinvestigation of the present author on this problem in [BIT \{{\textbackslash}bf 60\}(2020),no.{\textasciitilde}4, 901--915; [msn] MR4179710 [/msn]]). There are other possible choicesof the``stabilizing'' compact set and, correspondingly, several stableextrapolation procedures. In particle physics, this principle wasapplied in the 1960s and 1970s [see S. Ciulli, Nuovo Cimento A (10) \{{\textbackslash}bf 61\} (1969), 787--816; [msn]MR0243781 [/msn]; Nuovo Cimento A (10) \{{\textbackslash}bf 62\} (1969), 301--318;[msn] MR0386517 [/msn]; R.{\textasciitilde}E.

B \{{\textbackslash}bf 63\} (1973), 285--300,{\textbackslash}doi\{10.1016/0550-3213(73)90147-8\}].In a special geometry, the restoration of continuity of analyticcontinuation can be achieved also for rational functions [I.{\textasciitilde}S. Stefanescu, J. Math. Phys. \{{\textbackslash}bf 21\} (1980), no.{\textasciitilde}1, 175--188; [msn]MR0556288 [/msn]]. Unfortunately, as long as noapplicationof such astabilizing principle (or equivalent) is available to restrict themotion and magnitude of the poles of general rational approximants, oneis compelled to judge their validity only according to vagueexpectations or preferences.{\textbackslash}par To conclude, this survey is an excellent primer in approximationtheory, but can also leave the reader in a confused stateconcerning the reliability of numerical analytic continuation byunrestricted rational functions.},

	abstract = {Functional data analysis (FDA) deals with the statisticaldescription and modeling of data treated as functions, curves andsurfaces. Such data appear in many practical applications in economics,industry, medicine, meteorology, etc. The observations are obtainedrepeatedly as values of functions in a grid of time points, which maybe dense or sparse. Many standard statistical methods are adapted foruse with functional data. Naturally, the functional regression analysisis widely considered in practice. It is used to describe therelationship between response and explanatory variables when at leastone of them contains a random function. The three main functionalregression models are as follows: the functional response model (theresponses are curves, but the predictors are known scalars), thescalar-on-function model (the responses are scalars and the predictorsare curves), and the function-on-function model (the responses andregressors are functions). However, in the FDA, a quite new issue isconstructing a sampling schedule for collecting informative functionaldata to make a precise statistical inference. In this paper, theoptimal sampling schedules for recovering the trajectory of a predictorfunction and a response in the function-on-function regression modelare investigated. First of all, the known optimality criteria for thescalar-on-function regression model are extended to thefunction-on-function regression model. The construction of optimalitycriteria is as follows: First, the Karhunen-Loève expansions of thepredictor function and the response function are provided using thefunctional principal component analysis. Using these expansions, theauthors rewrite the function-on-function linear regression model in amore convenient form. Roughly speaking, it is orthogonally decomposed.Truncating these decompositions of predictor function and modelfunction as well as estimating unknown parameters, the authors obtainthe predictions of the predictor and response functions, which convergepointwise to normal distributions. Naturally, the variances of thesedistributions are used to formulate the optimality criteria, whosemaximizing results in minimizing the variances in some sense. Theoptimality criteria are the weighted sum criteria that strike thebalance between the statistical efficiencies in recovering thefunctional predictor and predicting the response. The user-specifiedweights meet the experimenter's needs when one of the objectives ismore important than the other. To find the optimal design under thesecriteria with \$p\$ time points on a discretized domain that has \$N\&gt;p\$equally spaced points, the exhaustive search algorithm, a greedy searchalgorithm, a simple exchange algorithm, a \$k\$-exchange algorithm andprobabilistic subset search (PSS) algorithm are studied. The first fouralgorithms are widely considered in finding optimal experimentaldesigns. The new PSS algorithm involves the selection of subsets ofcandidate time points based on the probability distributions defined bythe estimated variance of the functional predictor. Due to randomlyselecting candidate points, this algorithm has the ability to avoidbeing caught in local optimum. Furthermore, the estimated variancebased distribution used for selecting points helps to accelerate theconvergence of the PSS algorithm. It is also much less computationallyintensive than the exhaustive search algorithm. The performance of thePSS algorithm and its comparison with existing approaches is studied inextensive simulation experiments and examples with real data sets. Theauthors' results indicate that this algorithm is a powerful searchalgorithm and outperforms the competitors in terms of speed andachieved design efficiency. To sum up, the methodology presented in thepaper significantly extends the known results in finding design optimalsampling plans for functional regression models, which can be seen as anew branch of the FDA.},

	abstract = {In this task‐repetition intervention study, L2 learners’ reuse of linguistic constructions was analyzed to investigate to what extent recurring reliance on specific constructions during the same task repetition predicts fluency development. English‐as‐a‐foreign‐language (EFL) learners performed oral narrative tasks three times per day under two task repetition schedules: blocked (Day 1: Prompt A‐A‐A, Day 2: B‐B‐B, Day 3: C‐C‐C) versus interleaved (Day 1: Prompt A‐B‐C, Day 2: A‐B‐C, Day 3: A‐B‐C). From a usage‐based perspective, their reuse of constructions across the same prompt was examined at both concrete (lexical unigram [e.g., “bicycle”] and trigram [e.g., “behind the bicycle”]) and abstract (parts of speech trigram [e.g., “preposition determiner noun”]) level. Subsequent analyses revealed that blocked practice led to higher reuse of both concrete and abstract constructions than interleaved practice. Reuse frequency was correlated with during‐training and pretest–posttest fluency changes. Particularly, greater reuse of lexical and abstract trigrams during interleaved practice led to improvements in speed and breakdown fluency (i.e., shorter mean syllable duration and fewer mid‐clause pauses) after the intervention, albeit with higher effort (indicated by longer mid‐clause and clause‐final pauses). Taken together, these findings indicate that manipulating task‐repetition schedule may systematically induce reuse of linguistic constructions, which may promote proceduralization (entrenchment) of constructional knowledge at both concrete and abstract levels.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental practices in private clinics in Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out, using an online questionnaire indexed in Google Forms, and distributed among dentists. The data obtained were analyzed using the IBM SPSS 25.0 software, evaluating the factors associated with strong or very strong impact on the participants' income and the factors that motivated the dentists to look for a credit line. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed to identify the associated factors. Variables with p \&lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Most participants were female, with a median age of 35 years. Dentists who are most concerned about their professional future (OR = 3.134; 95\% CI: 1.804–5.445), who have longer office hours (OR = 2.056; 95\% CI: 1.198–3.529), who had the greatest impact on the flow of patients (OR = 16.358; 95\% CI: 9.408–28.443) and in need of investing in infrastructure (OR = 1.756; 95\% CI: 1.014–3.041), had the greatest impact on monthly earnings. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic and the new biosafety recommendations for care during this period had a negative impact on the income of Brazilian dental offices and increased the chance of seeking credit to alleviate the financial deficit.},

Very limited data exists that quantifies the burden of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) among OMS. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study seeks to address these literature gaps by assessing the prevalence of MSD among OMS. METHOD: A 12-question survey was designed to investigate the prevalence of MSD for OMS, including residents in training, actively practicing surgeons, and retired surgeons. Seventy-six surveys were distributed and completed in person by surgeons attending professional conferences from September 2018-September 2019. Survey questions included the Baker-Wong Faces pain scale, years in practice, number of hours worked per week, job tenure, pain attributable to work, and age. The Nordic scale identified and delineated anatomic site of musculoskeletal complaints, duration and treatment sought. RESULTS: The most frequently cited sources and locations of pain attributable to occupation were shoulders, neck, and lower back. The risk of MSD symptoms was relatively two-fold [PR = 2.54, 95\% CI = 0.90, 7.22] among OMS in practice for more than ten years compared to those in practice less than ten years. After adjusting for age and hours worked per week as potential confounders, the risk of MSD symptoms was higher among OMS in practice for more than ten years compared to those with less than ten years of experience, despite no statistically significant association. CONCLUSION: OMS are impacted by a high prevalence of MSD. The neck, shoulder, and lower back are the most frequently affected with discomfort and pain. This study found that practicing oral and maxillofacial surgery for more than 10 years is a potential risk factor for experiencing MSD.

OBJECTIVES: Assessing the impact of the COVID-19 on dental practices and anxiety levels in risk group Brazilian dentists. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using an online questionnaire. The data obtained were analyzed using the IBM SPSS 25.0 software (Pearson's Chi-square association test, multivariate logistic regression, and Poisson multiple regression), with subsequent calculation of the odds ratio at a 95\% confidence interval, with a significance level of 5\%. RESULTS: Responses of 578 dentists distributed in all regions of Brazil were collected. Most of the dentists were female, with an average age of 35. Of the participants, 23.4\% were part of the increased risk group for COVID-19. The professionals who belonged to the increased risk group had a greater chance of not feeling prepared to perform consultations (OR = 1.67) and were not performing any procedures during the pandemic (OR = 2.03). Belonging to the increased risk group did not influence anxiety levels among the dentists. The factors associated with increased anxiety were being female, being younger, working in the southeastern region of the country, being afraid of contracting COVID-19 while working, and being concerned for one's professional future. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had a negative impact on the professional practice of individuals at risk, but the level of anxiety was like professionals who were not part of the increased risk group for COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Although task complexity effects on L2 oral production have been widely studied in teaching contexts, their application to task-based language assessment and pragmatic language use remains underexplored. Since pragmatic competence is part of effective communication and interactional abilities and is context-dependent, an investigation of the relationships among task complexity, pragmatic language use, and paired speaking test performance is needed. This study examined the effect of the resource-directing and resource-dispersing dimensions (the number of elements, causal reasoning demand, and planning time) of Robinson's task complexity construct on fifty-two intermediate-level English as a Second Language (ESL) learners' rapport-building language use during two decision-making tasks as the achievement test in an EAP program, and the relationships between rapport language use and three dimensions of paired speaking test performance: collaboration, task completion, and style. The results showed that frequency and variety of rapport-building language use did not significantly differ between the two tasks. However, the study found that only in the simple task did different types of rapport-building language have statistically significant positive or negative relationships with different dimensions of paired speaking test scores. Specifically, greeting language use had a strong or close to strong positive relationship with collaboration and style scores, whereas agreeing language had a strong negative relationship with collaboration scores. Additionally, thanking language had a strong negative association with task completion scores. The findings further suggest that task complexity effects learners' production of rapport-building language in terms of alignment with their peer interlocutors and formality of style, and also impacts raters' perceptions of paired speaking task performance. The findings highlight the importance of task effects, paired oral assessment rubrics development, and rapport-building language instruction.},

A pretest/posttest design with repeated measures was used, which appears to be the only way to control for differences in task complexity (Larsen-Freeman, 2006) despite claims of carryover effects (Abbuhl et al., 2014). The major methodological concern was to describe EFL writing - an under-researched topic - in all its complexity and multidimensionality (Alanen et al., 2010). The decisions regarding the communicative written tasks administered, the building of the corpus, and especially the mixed methods for evaluating the written production obtained were made accordingly. All things considered, a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to measure and characterize EFL writing is advocated in order to capture all its richness.},

It presents the results of a task examining the acquisition of plosive voicing contrasts by college students with Cypriot Greek (CG) linguistic background. The task focused on the types of errors involving plosive consonants indicating that performance was significantly better in the voiceless plosive category. Participants were able to perceive voiced plosives but they treated such instances as a /nasal + voiced plosive/ sequence. Therefore, the question raised concerns different phonological contrasts realised through similar phonetic cues. The patterns observed suggested that this gap between phonetic cues and phonological contrast might explain why CG users have difficulties perceiving voiced English plosives. In this context, voice onset time (VOT) differences between the L1 and L2 are of crucial importance. In English, voiced plosives are characterised by short lag VOT while their voiceless counterparts fall within the long lag VOT continuum. The same phonetic contrast is used in CG to differentiate between single and geminate voiceless plosives. The results are discussed in relation to the frameworks of second language phonology and speech perception suggesting that the difficulties faced by the L2 listeners support the operation of a phonetic-phonological challenge.},

Current theoretical models suggest that these difficulties are related to the acquisition of a native speech system but diverge in whether the perceptual mechanisms operate on acoustic or articulatory information. The present research addresses: (1) the difficulties Cypriot Greek (CGR) listeners of L2 English encounter with English vowels and consonants, and (2) the effect of extra-linguistic (i.e. age, gender, years of learning L2 English, educational setting, age of onset, reported use in the L2, visits to English-speaking countries) and linguistic factors (word frequency, word length, syllable number) on the perception of vowels and consonants in L2 English. A task involving two discrimination tests assessed native CGR listeners' perception of English contrasts for vowels and consonants. Overall, listeners performed slightly better when dealing with consonants compared to vowels, significant effects have been reported. Concerning the examined factors, age, gender, years of L2 instruction, and years of experience have been reported to have significant effects, especially on speech perception of consonants. Specifically, the findings suggest that acoustic cues such as voicing and vowel length, which are relevant for native speakers of English, may not be for non-native speakers, in this case for CGR L1 speakers.},

The present paper explores the efficacy of the transfer of English as a Foreign Language from the classrooms of Macao Polytechnic Institute to graduates' workplace settings. The present study investigates such transfer by using a mixed methods approach involving firstly an analysis of one item on "foreign language" in an annual institutional survey questionnaire of 122 employers of MPI graduates followed by in-depth interviews of two of those employers regarding the same item. The results of the survey indicate that employers found the performance of the graduates "ordinary" and "were not satisfied" with their performance on "foreign language". Essentially, the graduates' performance in the productive language skills of speaking and writing are unsatisfactory, while their receptive language skills of listening and reading fare little better. Meanwhile, the results of the follow-up interviews provide much pause for thought on the historical roots of the extent of present-day foreign language competence. Finally, this research offers a range of suggestions for enhancing foreign language skills with a view to promoting the future employment prospects of graduates.},

	abstract = {While 85\% of young Australians have a secondary school qualification, the Department of Jobs and Small Business forecast that approximately 90\% of jobs created in 2022 would require higher qualifications. Enhancing student participation in tertiary learning, to improve their confidence and communication besides employability is the focus of this study. Elements such as communication and confidence that emanate out of participation in classroom discussions come to the foreground in this reflective study. Important factors that limit student participation are the inherent cultural shyness and language of international students. Use of language within an intercultural context could either contribute or reinforce barriers to participation in classroom discussions. This paper focuses on international post-graduate students and aims to achieve the dual objective of improved communication and confidence through classroom participation. Aiming to understand how intercultural competence can either enhanced or diminished the researcher uses own teaching and learning practices to transform the teaching and learning pedagogy to be more participatory. Using qualitative research methodology for a sample size of 149 students, this research uses complete observer method to capture the classroom participation of students in a participatory learning environment. Spread across 4 trimesters of study period, class size for this study ranges from 11-35 students. Tabular and graphical representations support the observations made. Using student engagement as a primary calibration, this paper expounds how traditional learning and teaching methods are of minimal help in trying to alleviate the inhibition and cultural shyness rampant in international students. This study delineates a few recommendations that are primarily focussing on participatory learning, peer motivation and constructive feedback, all of which help mitigate cultural shyness and language issues. The research concludes summing up the need to transform from a traditional to a participatory learning and teaching pedagogy and expounds on some gaps in the paper surrounding the use of Artificial Intelligence in higher education.},

In two experiments, two groups of Chinese learners of English immersed in the L1 environment, one less proficient and the other more proficient in English, performed a translation recognition task. In this task, participants judged whether pairs of words, with an L2 word preceding an L1 word, were translation words or not. The critical conditions compared the performance of learners to reject distractors that were related to the translation word (e.g., \&lt;inline-graphic\&gt;\&lt;/inline-graphic\&gt;, pronounced as /bei 1/) of an L2 word (e.g., \&lt;italic\&gt;cup\&lt;/italic\&gt;) in orthography (e.g., \&lt;inline-graphic\&gt;\&lt;/inline-graphic\&gt;, bad in Chinese, pronounced as /huai 4/) or phonology (e.g., \&lt;inline-graphic\&gt;\&lt;/inline-graphic\&gt;, sad in Chinese, pronounced as /bei 1/). Results of Experiment 1 showed less proficient learners were slower and less accurate to reject translation orthography distractors, as compared to unrelated controls, demonstrating a robust translation orthography interference effect. In contrast, their performance was not significantly different when rejecting translation phonology distractors, relative to unrelated controls, showing no translation phonology interference. The same patterns were observed in more proficient learners in Experiment 2. Together, these results suggest that when Chinese learners of English read English words, the orthographic information, but not the phonological information of the Chinese translation words is activated. In addition, this activation is not modulated by L2 proficiency.},

Drawing on language and non-language ideologies (Bucholtz, 2001) and semiotic processes of differentiation (Irvine \&amp; Gal, 2000), particularly fractal recursivity, focusing on relevant practices and discourses, I analyze and delineate linguistic injuries suffered and perpetuated by First- and Second-Generation members. Exploring their origins and manifestations, I tentatively define linguistic injuries as psychological damages caused by judgement based on language or language use at the interpersonal and institutional levels, but originated from "structures" such as ideology and legislation.

Learners that received indirect CF showed a high level of engagement which helped them correct their errors in text rewriting. Nevertheless, this effort might have been mitigated in the long term by not knowing whether their solutions were correct. Learners that received direct CF, which gave them input in the TL and the possibility to process it immediately, showed greater accuracy improvements in subsequent written and oral productions.},

Employing a rhizoanalytic research approach that acknowledgeswonderas an analytic practice (MacLure, 2013), we map interview data from two qualitative studies with immigrant language learners to show (a) how affective relations involving an adolescent French second language student disrupt received understandings of motivation; and (b) how reading a poem in an adult English second language classroom disrupts anticipated, affective responses to a lesson. Our rhizoanalysis underscores the complexity and unpredictability of the becomings ofanimmigrant life in the context of meeting the primary objective of teaching Canada’s official languages.

Their vocabulary knowledge was measured by Vocabulary Levels Tests targeting words that belong to 2000, 3000 and 5000 frequency levels. This vocabulary knowledge was assessed in relation to a few factors, namely, the self-rated overall English proficiency, the average EFL grade during elementary and high school, the type of high school attended, and the length of formal EFL learning. The students achieved much higher scores on the receptive than productive knowledge measure, the former ranging from M = 9.94 to M = 13.95, and the latter from M = 4.45 to M = 8.78, with the gap between receptive and productive scores being the greatest between scores for 3000 frequency level words. The results of MANOVA and ANOVA statistical tests showed that all the aforementioned factors, except for the length of learning English, significantly impacted both receptive and productive EFL vocabulary knowledge. This study is expected to significantly contribute to current understanding of EFL learning, and vocabulary knowledge development as its integral part, in the Global South context. It will offer both students and teachers a valuable assessment of the current situation, along with practical guidelines for further improvement in this respect.},

Private speech is the overt audible self-talk people produce when engaged with challenging problem-solving tasks and is believed to aid in second language acquisition as reported (Vygotsky in Thought and language, MIT Press, 1962); (Winsler in Private Speech, Executive Functioning, and the Development of Verbal Self-Regulation, 2009). This qualitative case study explored private speech production in three young adolescents (two 11-year-olds and one 10-year-old) while completing an English as a foreign language task (Bingo! game) individually and collaboratively in physical and digital modes. Patterns of participants’ private speech markers emerged from a thematic analysis of the transcribed oral interactions during eight sessions. The frequency of occurrence of the participants’ private speech markers was reported and interpreted based on the emergent typology to compare collaborative and individual task completion in physical and digital modes. Regardless of the individual or collaborative nature of the task, private speech use decreased during the digital version of the game. However, collaborative tasks evoked more private speech from the participants regardless of modality. The findings of the study suggest digital media usage is likely to hinder private speech production for self-regulatory purposes in young adolescents, even in collaboration with peers.},

Findings revealed how multimodal composing supported students in learning French through metalinguistic practices of rehearsal and repair. Students further problematized cultural stereotypes through multimodal compositions. Additionally, students developed identities as legitimate multilingual multimodal composers by using French and other semiotic modes to create personalized design aesthetics. These findings illustrate the important ways that semiotic modes can interact to develop language, cultural awareness, and identity during study abroad.

	abstract = {Simultaneous interpreting (SI) is a cognitively complex activity due to the concurrent nature of receiving and producing messages. Previous research confirms that SI is profoundly influenced by cognitive, attitudinal, and psychological mechanisms. Following this line of enquiry, the present investigation proposes a unique model by integrating cognitive and psychological factors related to the professional performance in SI. Specifically, this study examined a model to test the predictive and mediational effects of emotional intelligence, creativity, self-efficacy, and field dependence/independence (FD/FI) on simultaneous interpreting. A total of 248 university students majoring in Translation Studies completed measures of General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), Emotional-Quotient Inventory (EQ-I), Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), General Embedded Figures Test (GMFT), and two SI tasks, namely the oral cloze test (OCT) and the listening and memory recall exercise (LMRE). The path analysis supported the direct effect of creativity and its indirect effects mediated by FD/FI on SI. Emotional intelligence made only a significant indirect effect on SI through FD/FI. Self-efficacy, on the other hand, made only a significant direct effect on SI. Emotional intelligence and creativity also contributed significantly to the prediction of FD/FI. The analyses also revealed a significant correlation between emotional intelligence and self-efficacy and also between creativity and emotional intelligence. Finally, FD/FI directly predicted simultaneous interpreting. Other hypothesized associations were not found to be statistically significant. The findings suggest that psychological attributes can have a great impact on students' performance in simultaneous interpreting training exercises. Implications of the study and the research avenues are discussed.},

Notably, an exception arises, as human-likeness does not significantly predict students' perceived ease of use in our research context. Students' perceived systemic interactivity and impact on the learning process emerge as pivotal mediators. The qualitative thematic analysis identifies students' concerns about classroom administration, developmental support, technical issues, deprived interpersonal collaboration, and liberal attainment cultivation with the virtual teacher presence.

As a result, the demand for English language education has been on the rise. In China, a significant number of individuals are engaged in learning the English language. However, many English learners in China encounter challenges when it comes to developing their speaking skills. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the speaking skills of English learners in China. Employing a mixed-methods approach, data were collected through a questionnaire from 455 college students from three different courses (arts, science \&amp; business, and commerce) in China. The study findings identified several factors impacting the speaking skills of English learners in China, including limited opportunities for speaking practice, fear of making mistakes, limited exposure to English-speaking environments, inadequate teacher training, and the influence of the Chinese language on English pronunciation. Additionally, the study highlighted that learners who have greater exposure to English-speaking environments and more opportunities for speaking practice tend to demonstrate better speaking skills. The novelty of this study lies in its valuable insights into the factors influencing the speaking skills of English learners in China. Based on the findings, it is recommended that English teachers receive enhanced training to effectively teach speaking skills, and learners should be provided with increased opportunities for speaking practice, such as participating in group discussions or engaging in speaking activities.},

The results showed some differences in correlations between Japanese and United States samples, which was explained by analyzing a trait of Japanese culture that is characterized as highly contextual. Regarding the correlations between communication variables and parliamentary debate participation, significant differences were found for all variables except for communication competence, where less communication apprehension, more argument approach, less argument avoidance, and more willingness to communicate were observed compared to non-debaters. Finally, the study findings revealed that those with parliamentary debate experience obtained lower scores for communication apprehension and higher scores for argumentative approaches compared with those who did not have such experience; the effect sizes were smaller in women than men. These findings suggest that parliamentary debate participation is an effective way to foster communication variables.},

	abstract = {Within the new era of artificial intelligence (AI), education industry should develop in the direction of intelligence and digitalization. For evaluating learners' academic performances, English high-stakes test is not only a mere means for measuring what English as a Foreign Language (EFL) stakeholders know or do not know but also likely to bring life-changing consequences. Hence, effective test preparation for English high-stakes test is crucial for those who futures depend on attaining a particular score. However, traditional corpus-based approaches cannot simultaneously take words' frequency and range variables into consideration when evaluating their importance level, which makes the word sorting results inaccurate. Thus, to effectively and accurately extract critical words among English high-stakes test for enhancing EFL stakeholders' test performance, this paper integrates a corpus-based approach and a revised Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) method to develop a novel frequency-range analysis (FRA) method. Taiwan College Entrance Exam of English Subject (TCEEES) from the year of 2001 to 2022 are adopted as an empirical case of English high stake test and the target corpus for verification. Results indicate that the critical words evaluated by FRA method are concentrated on Quadrant I including 1,576 word types that account for over 60\% running words of TCEEES corpus. After compared with the three traditional corpus-based approaches and the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method, the significant contributions include: (1) the FRA method can use a machine-based function words elimination technique to enhance the efficiency; (2) the FRA method can simultaneously take words' frequency and range variables into consideration; (3) the FRA method can effectively conduct cluster analysis by categorizing the words into the four quadrants that based on their relative importance level. The results will give EFL stakeholders a clearer picture of how to allocate their learning time and education resources into critical words acquisition.},

To this end, 60 EFL learners out of one-hundred were selected through the administration of an Oxford Placement Test from three language institutes and divided into 3 groups (two experimental and one control group) each including 20 intermediate EFL learners. The first experimental group received teacher-scaffolding instruction, the second experimental group received peer-scaffolding instruction and the control group received traditional instruction with no scaffolding. The vocabulary and reading comprehension pre-tests were administered to the three groups. At the end of the experiment, the vocabulary and reading comprehension post-tests were administered. The descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and the inferential statistics (a One-way ANOVA) were run to analyze the collected data. The results showed that both experimental groups had better performance than the control group and there was a significant difference between teacher-scaffolding and peer-scaffolding in both vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension performance and the peer-scaffolding group had a better performance than the teacher-scaffolding group.

	abstract = {Background: Teachers and clinicians may struggle to provide early identification to support multilingual children's language development. Dynamic assessments are a promising approach to identify and support children's language development. Aims: We developed and studied a novel word learning task that is dynamic and language neutral. It makes use of multilingual children's abilities to apply language transfer, fast mapping and socially embedded language to the learning of new words. Methods \&amp; Procedures: A total of 26 children attending kindergarten in French participated in this study. Within this group, 13 different home languages were spoken. Children took part in a dynamic assessment task of their word learning that consisted of a test–teach–retest task. Children's scores on this task were compared with their language abilities reported by their parents, amount of language exposure and scores on standardized tests of vocabulary. All tasks were delivered in French. Outcomes \&amp; Results: Children had higher accuracy for known words as compared with new words in the task, which may suggest transfer of knowledge from their first language. They also showed increased accuracy in identifying and naming the new words across the three trials, suggesting fast mapping of these new vocabulary items. Finally, the scores on the dynamic task correlated to children's vocabulary scores on the standardized tests, but not parent report of language development, or the amount of exposure to the language of school. Conclusions \&amp; Implications: This novel dynamic assessment task taps into the process of vocabulary learning, but is less influenced by prior language knowledge. Together, these findings provide insight into early word learning by young multilingual children and proposes a conceptual model for identifying strategies to support second language acquisition. What this paper adds: What is already known on the subject: Many barriers exist with regards to assessing the language abilities of multilingual children when a clinician aims to assess their language abilities in both languages. An alternative approach is to measure children's language processing abilities. What this paper adds to existing knowledge: A novel dynamic and multilingual task was developed and implemented in this study. This task builds on children's word learning abilities that include cross‐language transfer, fast‐mapping, and socially imbedded learning. This multilingual task was found to tap into vocabulary learning but was not influenced by prior language knowledge. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?: Applying a task that focuses on language processing abilities is a promising strategy to capture language abilities in multilingual children. In addition, the dynamic nature of this tasks allows a clinician to identify scaffolding strategies that best support children's word learning.},

The findings showed these scholars constructed their professional identities through negotiating English as a teaching language in ways interwoven with students' needs, institutional policies, and their past experiences. The Chinese returnee scholars were found to be "rootless" in terms of possessing inadequate social and cultural capital locally, resulting in limited collaboration and difficulties developing sufficiently robust language competency to publish bilingually. Some scholars, however, employed accumulated capital to exercise agency in bringing about changes in their new academic environments. Implications for bilingual returnee scholars and university policymakers are discussed.},

Using a subjective expected utility framework, I argue that higher writing standards for women are consistent with these stylised facts. A counterfactual analysis suggests that senior female economists may, as a result, write at least 5\% more clearly than they otherwise would.

	abstract = {This study aimed to explore the implementation of the Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) policy by public elementary teachers in the Philippines through a case study approach. Specifically, the study sought to examine how three elementary teachers in one public school institution distinctively implement the MTB-MLE policy in their classrooms. The study used a qualitative research design, specifically in-depth individual interviews with the selected teachers, to gather rich data about their experiences and practices in implementing the policy in order to shed light on the actual classroom practices of teachers in implementing the MTB-MLE policy, which has been mandated by the government to promote language and literacy development among young learners. The outputs of this study engage deeply with practices and experiences of selected teachers implementing the MTB-MLE policy. Key challenges include the scarcity of ready printed materials for MTB-MLE, perceptions of MTB-MLE as an additional subject burden, struggles with translating technical terms into local dialects, and the complexity of the policy itself. Opportunities identified include the potential for fostering deeper cultural connections among students, enhancing comprehension through native language instruction, and the pivotal role of parents in the MTB-MLE process. Considering these insights, this study advocates for the development of more localized learning materials, refining the policy to reduce perceived burdens, and initiatives to involve parents and address any negative attitudes. The implications of this research can influence policy and practice in education, improve instructional quality, and boost the language and literacy development of young learners in the Philippines. Further, this research contributes to refining Spolsky's (Spolsky, Language policy, Cambridge University Press, 2004) theory of language policy, suggesting that it should incorporate the diverse linguistic resources available to actors, acknowledging status and hierarchies among languages. The study highlights the various considerations that may shape language preferences, proposing that a more illustrative language policy theory should prominently feature both the managers and those subject to the policy.},

Many studies have looked at the use and adoption rates of social media in language education, but studies that take a more fine-grained understanding of the differences between individual features of social media and how they are perceived by learners and teachers are rare. We present an analysis of the results of two workshops in a UK university that illustrate disparities between how individual features of social media are used generally, and how they are used for educational purposes between learners and teachers of languages. To understand the underlying perceptions of and attitudes towards features of social media we performed an inductive thematic analysis of discussion data generated at the workshops. From this we surface three themes: social media as distinct language type; navigating appropriateness; and prioritizing authentic communication flow. From these themes, we offer four design recommendations for practitioners and researchers who wish to incorporate social media in language teaching. These recommendations are: pay attention to specific features of social media and model authentic use; create learner-led and learner-owned spaces; create structured pathways to authentic social media use; and incorporate social media in assessment.},

Although a proliferation of digital storytelling authoring tools has been introduced to improve learning, there is a lack of systematic review to inform how it has been designed and developed as well as implemented in education. This paper presents a systematic review of 91 studies highlighting the technology and use trends related to authoring tools in educational digital storytelling. Our analysis identifies best practices in designing the authoring tools, synthesized as design guidelines for future researchers and practitioners in the field. Possible challenges of incorporating the tools in the classroom are explored, and directions for future design and development of similar tools are suggested.},

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that various user characteristics (e.g., cognitive abilities, personality traits, and learning abilities) can influence user experience during information visualization tasks. These findings have prompted researchers to investigate user-adaptive information visualizations that can help users by providing personalized support based on their specific needs. Whereas existing work has been mostly limited to tasks involving just visualizations, the aim of our research is to broaden this work to include scenarios where users process textual documents with embedded visualizations, i.e., Magazine Style Narrative Visualizations, or MSNVs for short. In this paper, we analyze eye tracking data collected from a user study with MSNVs to uncover processing behaviors that are negatively impacting user experience (i.e., time on task) for users with low abilities in these user characteristics. Our analysis leverages Linear Mixed-Effects Models to evaluate the relationships among user characteristics, gaze processing behaviors, and task performance. Our results identify several MSNV processing behaviors within the visualization that contribute to poor task performance for users with low reading proficiency. For instance, we identify that users with low reading proficiency transition significantly more often compared to their counterparts between relevant and non-relevant bars, and transition more often from bars to the labels. We present our findings as a step toward designing user-adaptive support mechanisms to alleviate these difficulties with MSNVs, and provide suggestions on how our results can be leveraged for creating a set of meaningful interventions for future evaluation (e.g., dynamically highlighting relevant bars and labels in the visualization to help users with low reading proficiency locate them more effectively).},

	abstract = {Hearing impairment is a common chronic condition in middle-aged and elderly adults. The number of individuals with hearing impairment is expected to rise because of the longer life expectancies and trends in the population growth. Acquired hearing impairment in adulthood is not just a disorder of the sense of hearing. It is primarily a social disability because its handicapping effect is experienced in interaction with other people. This paper aims to explore how the repair of problems in hearing is initiated by hearing-impaired individuals with acquired mild to severe hearing impairment. By using the method of conversation analysis (CA), this paper examines the occurrence of other-initiations of repair (OIR) and how it is typically resolved in actual mundane interaction. In addition, this paper reveals the challenges and the impact of hearing impairment as the state of hearing deteriorates. This article argues that the frequency of OIR in mild hearing impairment does not differ from normally hearing individuals. However, in a more severe grade of hearing impairment, the OIR sequences are longer, more frequent, multimodal and may require more vigilance from the normally-hearing conversation partner. Implications for counselling are suggested.},

Regular access to the classroom develops capabilities, intelligence, emotional, critical thinking, and higher-order abstraction skills. A serious problem is the lack of confidence and administration. However, building student societies are now taking the initiative to change teaching methods in colleges and independent organizations. Several physical action human-computer interaction (HCI) competitions designed to improve interest, sentiment, and visual coordination will be presented in this article. The lack of professional teachers within the area is a further problem in teaching a particular course. In this article, the artificial intelligence-based dramatic social organization material (AI-DSOM) framework has been proposed to solve the challenges faced in drama education. Developing children's first language is fundamental to cognitive development because it provides new language opportunities. Data analysis technique can be applied to evaluate, understand, and analyze the problem to provide a cognitive awareness object considered inanimate. Furthermore, grammatical evaluations using deep learning are an effective and efficient technological solution with A.I. technology used to regulate and automate resources. The adaptive difficulty-based system aims to keep players interested in their games. Children with hearing impairments are being used as part of an ongoing project to develop adaptive educational systems based on HCI. These combined chores of method eliminate loss of time and energy in teaching by drama method. Simulation results show that proposed method enhances performance, knowledge, vocabulary, and efficiency compared to existing models.},

Thus, this study aimed to explore the effects of G-DA and PBI on fostering EFL learners' metacognitive awareness (MA) and listening comprehension (LC) in Iran. For this purpose, a total of one hundred and sixty intermediate EFL learners were selected through a convenience sampling method at Iran Language Institute (ILI) and were homogenized using the Key English Test (KET). The EFL learners whose scores fell around the mean score were chosen and randomly allocated as G-DA group (n = 30), PBI group (n = 30), and control group (n = 30). Afterward, they went through a pre-test, interventions (lasting 16 one-hour sessions held twice a week) and a post-test. The interactions in the classes were also meticulously recorded. The collected data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA and a microgenetic development approach. Findings evidenced that the G-DA group and PBI group outperformed the control group concerning the gains in MA and LC. However, the findings evidenced that G-DA was more effective than PBI to foster the EFL learners' MA and LC. Additionally, the complementary qualitative results documented that the proper feedback offered in line with the principles and procedures of G-DA and PBI contributed to developing the participants' MA and LC. The study ends by offering some implications for the relevant stakeholders.},

Presentations were transcribed to identify features of performance, including utterance fluency, and speaking breadth and depth. Outcomes indicated that an audience of computer-generated agents resulted in less PSA than an audience of photorealistic people familiar to the speakers. Additionally, presenting to an audience of strangers in real life induced the most anxiety, but the performance features of articulation rate, disfluencies, and frequency of silent pauses were significantly improved in this condition. The main contribution of this study is to show that presentations directed at virtual audiences exhibit less fluent speech in non-native speakers than speeches to a real audience.},

It also delves into gauging the awareness level of these students about the AI-driven tools designed for speaking skill augmentation, and specifically investigates which AI-based systems are used by Saudi EFL students to improve their speaking skills. The research methodology, a quantitative survey, utilized a structured digital questionnaire focusing on students' usage, perceptions, and experiences with AI applications in EFL speaking practice. This questionnaire included items on the frequency of use, types of AI tools employed, and perceived effectiveness of these tools in enhancing speaking skills. A digital questionnaire was administered to 75 fourth-year students from the Department of Linguistics at King Saudi University (KSU) located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Feedback was sought on the AI-centric platforms they employ to bolster their English-speaking proficiency. Of the initial group, 64 students provided their responses. Descriptive statistical methods, including frequency and percentage analysis, were used to interpret the collected data. Analysis revealed that a significant proportion of students were not only unfamiliar with specific AI tools but also skeptical about their efficacy in language learning. For instance, over 50\% of respondents reported minimal to no use of these tools, citing uncertainty over their benefits. The results indicate a predominant lack of awareness among the Saudi EFL learners about the potential impacts of AI tools on their speaking proficiency. Most participants were uncertain of the tangible benefits these AI tools might offer. This underscores a broader finding that awareness of AI-driven tools in foreign language learning remains in its infancy, emphasizing the need for further research and increased introduction of these platforms to learners. These findings point to a critical need for integrating AI technology awareness and training within EFL curricula, suggesting that more explicit guidance on the effective use of AI tools could foster better engagement and proficiency outcomes.},

While each tool demonstrates the potential of AI to enhance English language learning, they also present limitations, such as insufficient depth in conversational skills (Duolingo), limited advanced content (Babbel), and narrow focus on pronunciation (ELSA Speak). This paper concludes that a combined use of these AI tools can provide a more comprehensive learning experience, addressing diverse learner needs and supporting proficiency across multiple language skills.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (ai) technology is revolutionizing the way we live, learn, and work. In academic settings, tools such as chatbots, machine translation, and plagiarism detectors are becoming increasingly popular. However, as students’ use of these technologies becomes widespread, concerns about the impact it may have on learning, academic integrity, and the role of traditional teaching methods are growing. This paper aims to explore the perspectives of Argentinean teachers on the use of ai in higher education and on its advantages and drawbacks. Through an exploratory qualitative approach, we investigated how much knowledge teachers have about ai and whether they perceive its potential benefits and challenges and its impact on their teaching practices. Results show that L2 instructors exhibit low levels of familiarity and experience with these resources, specifically generative machine translation (gmt) and chat generative pre-trained transformer (gpt). Although some of the interviewees showed positive attitudes towards incorporating these tools into their classes, we also identify their fears and skepticism about these resources in higher education, their concerns about fairness and responsibility, and the lack of knowledge to engage with the software in teaching practices. The study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing efl instructors’ varied perspectives on ai, which is crucial for effectively integrating these technologies into L2 education.},

Interactive, conversation-based spoken dialog systems (SDSs) that use automated speech recognition and natural language processing have the potential to address this need by engaging learners in meaningful, goal-oriented speaking practice. However, these technology-based learning tools are often developed without input from teaching professionals. As part of a larger development effort, this study examined English as a second language (ESL) teachers’ perceptions regarding SDS-based speaking tasks, addressing the following research questions: (a) What do teachers think about the SDS-based tasks? (b) How would they use them in the context of their English instruction? Overall, 16 ESL instructors in an intensive English program in the United States were asked to interact with four SDS-based speaking tasks designed to elicit specific linguistic phenomena (e.g. making requests; wh-questions). The teachers completed a survey after each task to gauge their user experience, level of engagement, and perceptions of the usefulness of the tasks for their teaching contexts. A subgroup of instructors (n = 7) also participated in audio-recorded focus group meetings. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each survey item and the open-ended responses from the surveys and focus groups were analyzed qualitatively for major themes. The findings show that teachers had positive views of the SDS tasks’ potential for speaking practice and diagnostic purposes, primarily in a flipped classroom model. Their perceptions seemed to be related to their own user experience and, in particular, to the perceived authenticity of a given task.},

A quasi-experiment was conducted with 46 first-year students taking part in a required English course. They were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental and control groups (23 students for each, respectively). The experimental group was engaged in six chat sessions with a chatbot over 6 weeks. A pretest and a posttest were used to examine the effectiveness of the chatbot by comparing any changes made in error frequencies of the target grammar in participants' English compositions. The results show that after a conversation with the chatbot, the experimental group significantly reduced the mean of omission errors in both prepositions and articles. To have a great effect in other error categories, chatbot feedback needs to be improved to reduce short responses or inaccurate utterances of students and induce them to actively participate in the conversation.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of pre-listening activities on Arabic-speaking EFL learners' comprehension of spoken texts. Background This study aims to contribute to the current research and to increase our understanding about the effectiveness of pre-listening activities. Specifically, this study seeks to clarify some of the research in this area that seems to be incongruent. Methodology The study investigates two widely implemented activities in second language (L2) classrooms: vocabulary preteaching and content previewing. Ninety-three native-Arabic speaking EFL learners, whose proficiently levels were beginner, intermediate, or advanced, were randomly assigned to a control group or one of three experimental groups: the vocabulary-only (VO) group, content-only (CO) group, or vocabulary + content (VC) group. Each of the experimental groups received one of the treatments to determine which pre-listening activity was more effective and whether additional pre-listening activities yield additional comprehension. Listening comprehension of the aural text was measured by a test comprising 13 multiple-choice and true-false questions. Contribution The present study provided additional explanations regarding the long-standing contradicting results about vocabulary preteaching and content previewing. Findings The results showed that pre-listening activities had a positive impact on Arabicspeaking EFL learners' listening comprehension, with the VO group significantly increasing their scores on the posttest compared to those of the control or other groups. Vocabulary preteaching was particularly beneficial for more advanced learners. With regard to which pre-listening activity contributed the most to better listening comprehension, vocabulary preteaching was the most effective. Content previewing did not increase comprehension for the CO group and had no additional benefit for the VC group. Recommendations for Practitioners The results of this study suggest that providing L2 students with instruction on single words, multi-words, and idioms in the upcoming aural input has a positive impact on listening comprehension. The study provides positive evidence that vocabulary knowledge and word recognition play a major role in understanding L2 aural texts. It also provides support for the practice of vocabulary teaching in L2 listening classes. Recommendations for Researchers This paper recommends that researchers explore new pre-listening activities that have never studied. Future research should be extended to include other nations and contextual situations to extend our knowledge about the effect of pre-listening activities. As far as listening comprehension can only be achieved when listeners are attentive and engaged, the listening text should be interesting and the lexical coverage of the listening text should be appropriate for all participants. Future Research The results are to be interpreted carefully because they are limited by the students' L2 proficiency, demographic, and cultural backgrounds (i.e., first language (L1) proficiency, age, gender, Middle Eastern culture). Results might be quite different if the study was conducted with different populations who have different life and language learning experiences (Vandergrift \&amp; Baker, 2015). Therefore, the results of this study indicate there is much room for improvement and a need for further research.},

	abstract = {This study explores the effects of interacting with AI vs. human interlocutors on English language learners' speaking performance in a game-based learning context. We developed Taboo Talks, a word-guessing game in which learners alternated between giving and guessing clues with either an AI or a human partner. To evaluate the impact of interaction mode on oral proficiency, participants completed a story retelling task, assessed using complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) metrics. Each participant engaged in both partner conditions, with group order counterbalanced. The results from the retelling task indicated modest improvements in fluency and complexity, particularly following interaction with the AI partner. Accuracy scores remained largely stable across conditions. Post-task reflections revealed that learners perceived AI partners as less intimidating, facilitating more relaxed language production, though concerns were noted regarding limited responsiveness. Qualitative analysis of the gameplay transcripts further revealed contrasting interactional patterns: AI partners elicited more structured interactions whereas human partners prompted more spontaneous and variable interactions. These findings suggest that AI-mediated gameplay can enhance specific dimensions of spoken language development and may serve as a complementary resource alongside human interaction.},

In this paper, we integrate quantitative and qualitative studies to explore user behaviour in AEILS. Survey data was collected from 457 respondents and analysed using structural equation modelling with the smart-PLS software. The results showed that AEILS-specific affordances significantly affect flow experience and self-expansion, thus facilitating user engagement and alleviating FLSA. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to corroborate the findings of the quantitative study. These findings highlighted the importance of technology affordance in AEILS.

For English for Specific Purposes (ESP) teachers, there are few resources which identify the technical vocabulary of a field such as automotive technology. This article introduces an Automotive Technology Word List and accompanying lists of technical abbreviations (e.g. WOF, 4WD) and proper nouns. The three main aims of this article are as follows: (1) to outline features of technical vocabulary that are important for automotive technology; (2) to examine high-, mid- and low-frequency vocabulary in automotive technology, and how each of these frequency bands can present particular issues for L2 learners in the trades; and (3) to provide an evaluation of the Automotive Technology Word List. The article ends with suggestions on ways to use the list for planning, testing and strategy training and for production of teaching and learning materials.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) programs in tourism education through a comprehensive mixed-methods analysis conducted over an 18-month period (January 2023 - June 2024). The research involved 250 tourism students, 15 ESP instructors, and 10 industry professionals across five academic institutions in Kazakhstan. Using a combination of quantitative assessments and qualitative evaluations, the study measured improvements in language competencies, teaching methodology effectiveness, and practical application of skills in professional contexts. Results demonstrated significant improvements across all language skills, with notable increases in speaking proficiency (30\% improvement) and technical vocabulary acquisition (28\% improvement). Interactive teaching methods, particularly role-playing (85\% effectiveness) and field trips (82\% effectiveness), proved most successful in developing professional communication skills. The study also evaluated the impact of technology-enhanced learning (72\% effectiveness) and its integration with traditional teaching methods. Qualitative findings revealed enhanced professional confidence, improved cultural competence, and strong industry relevance of the ESP program. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on specialized language instruction in tourism contexts and provides evidence-based recommendations for ESP program development and implementation. The findings have significant implications for curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and industry training programs in the tourism sector.},

Both these areas are facing a rapid growth, with an increasing demand for teaching materials and improvement. Nowadays teachers face the challenge of developing not only general speech habits for their students but also rhetoric skills in order for the negotiations to be effective. The complex economic and political scene worldwide requires specific abilities for sophisticated communication. Thus, the teaching of the speaking skill has become increasingly important. Two decades ago, the accuracy of the students' language would most likely tend to be the major criterion whereas nowadays educators and researchers alike have come to the conclusion that communicative competence entails not only grammatical accuracy but also some other factors such as: sociocultural rules of appropriateness, discourse norms, and strategies for a rhetoric approach of the skills. Some applied linguists consider that the communicative competence comprises the following elements: grammatical or linguistic competence, socio-cultural competence, discourse competence and strategic competence. The present paper tries to express some of our ideas regarding the question: How can teachers of Business English improve their students' communication skills?},

However, there has been little research regarding the development of evidence-based principles for English for tourism purposes (ETP) through AR-based CAUL. The purpose of this study was to provide a preliminary analysis of the design principles and develop a learning model based on a rigorous four-phase Design-Based Research procedure. The researchers first developed a location-based AR application for ETP and formulated the first set of design principles. This application was further tested and refined in an iterative process, with data collected from three different sources. The data collection methods included an online questionnaire, onsite observations, and semi-structured expert interviews. All the data was triangulated and analyzed, and a team of experts evaluated the design principles. Results showed that the technical affordances of mobile AR devices should form the basis for the design. The application needs to seamlessly provide multimodal scenery-based AR learning supports to fulfill individual needs in blended learning contexts. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface with personalized functions and a portfolio recording the learning progress needs to be included. Multimodal authentic ETP dialogs and terminology are also necessary in order to build students’ ETP speaking competence. Moreover, the learning material should be compatible with the main theories which drive language learning in CAUL. In light of the findings, a learning model was established to guide AR-based ETP learning and serve as template for future studies in other ESP fields.},

A 12-item quantitative questionnaire using a four-point Likert scale and an open-ended qualitative questionnaire were used. The results showed that students considered self-created videos to be effective tools for developing their oracy skills. However, results were not conclusive for students’ preferences regarding mode of communication. Contrary to our expectations, a considerable number of students did not feel confident in their use of video presentations and felt intimidated by the cameras. This suggests that a greater emphasis should be put on the development of digital communication skills to prepare our students for the new communication reality.},

The Tree Pruning Hypothesis proposes that these deficits are attributed to the reduced ability to project higher nodes in the syntactic trees. However, it is not clear whether this theory can be used to account for the deficits of functional category production among Chinese-speaking agrammatic patients. Aims: The current study examined functional category deficits in Chinese-speaking agrammatic patients in relation to the degree of impairment severity in order to test the hierarchical nature of functional category deficits. Methods \&amp; Procedures: 21 Chinese-speaking patients with different degrees of severity and 10 non-brain-damaged controls participated in this study. The Chinese version of the Western Aphasia Battery and a picture description task were administered to examine the production of function words related to a Complementiser Phrase (CP), Tense Phrase (TP) and verb Phrase (vP). Outcomes and Results: The degrees of impairment severity had a significant influence on functional category deficits. All patients were relatively accurate at CP, regardless of their severity. The patients with severe aphasia had profound problems in both vP- and TP-related elements, whereas the patients with mild aphasia retained their ability to access to either. Specifically, the vP-related words were significantly more impaired than TP-related words. Conclusions: The asymmetrical deficits in functional category production suggest that the impairments might lie in the selection of lexical arrays at the vP phase, rather than functional categories per se. The findings provided the evidence for a lexically-based account for Chinese agrammatism.},

These profiles showed that: (1) differences in academic success are associated with a learner's capacity for motivational regulation and self-regulated learning strategy implementation, (2) online learners are more likely to belong to profiles that are more adaptive, and less reliant on collaborations with others, (3) for learners at the lower end of the self-regulation spectrum, an increase in both motivational regulation and adoption of self-regulated learning strategies may be academically beneficial, and (4) high motivational regulation and strategy adoption can be all for naught, if the student is also highly anxious with worry and concern regarding performance.},

This study contributes to realizing a method to evaluate the learning process, by tracing the stages of learning habits in long-term, and continuous learning activities.

Examples of hypothetical and existing empirical studies in the field of educational technology are used to illustrate the analysis. It is argued in this article that conceptual frameworks should be viewed as an instrument for organizing inquiry and creating a compelling theory-based and data-driven argument for the importance of the problem, rigor of the method, and implications for further development of theory and enhancement of practice.},

A sample of 3,026 tweets was taken for such purpose. By way of conclusion, it is worth noting that student participation in the education process via Twitter progressively increases as their technical knowledge of this tool improves and they feel more motivated. Interaction and learning within a community is underpinned by gratifying experiences. Thus, the use of Twitter in the learning process of university students is feasible and perceived as a motivating experience by them. However, teachers play an essential role as dynamisers in the formal incorporation of Twitter in the teaching process, as well as in enhancing interaction between the participants.},

A total of 55 university students volunteered to use the game to learn about programming, during which their visual behaviors were recorded by an eye tracker to investigate their cognitive engagement and visual transition patterns. Their prior knowledge of programming was assessed one week before the game started, while their learning achievement was tested immediately after the game ended. The results of the study showed that: (1) Students? prior knowledge had a moderately positive predictive effect on their learning achievement; (2) Students? learning concentration played a mediating role in the predictive effect of prior knowledge on learning achievement; (3) Students? cognitive strategies moderated the predictive effect of prior knowledge on learning achievement; and (4) Groups of students with different prior knowledge and cognitive engagement adopted significantly different modes of visual transformation in the game. These findings further revealed the complex relationship between learners? prior knowledge, cognitive engagement and learning achievement in the game environments, which would be a good reference for understanding individual differences in the game environment and for designing game-based adaptive learning systems.},

Researchers have also designed innovations or interventions for possible adoption by schools or for informal learning. Of critical interest to the community is the question of how the more successful of these top-down or bottom-up models or innovations can proliferate to more usage, adoption and adaptation across levels of the education system. This paper describes a research programme that demonstrates how to make successful research innovations count in practice and that delineates what types of educational R\&D involving scaling need to take place to make the critical link to impacting practice. We do this in the context of one such curricular innovation in a Singapore school that moves through the various phases to where the innovation is becoming an integral part of routine classroom practices.},

	abstract = {This study presents a new blended learning model that combines a computer-assisted learning system called Cognitive Apprenticeship Programming Learning System (CAPLS) with instructor co-teaching in an introductory programming course. CAPLS, as its unique aspect, functions as a master in cognitive apprenticeship, guiding learners throughout their learning while also assessing their progress. In contrast, the instructor in physical class settings serves a supportive role, monitoring progress and articulating as needed to fill knowledge gaps. To investigate the impact of this learning model on students? motivation, we used the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) at the beginning and end of the semester. College Entrance Math score, midterm and final exams were also used to assess student learning outcomes. The study was conducted with first-year students in the Department of Information and Computer Engineering, and two key findings emerged. First, students? programming proficiency was strongly correlated with their College Entrance Math scores. While math ability impacted programming learning, all students improved their final scores compared to their midterms, with high-scoring math students outperforming their peers. Second, the proposed blended cognitive teaching strategy significantly reduced students? extrinsic goal and self-efficacy levels, but their learning outcomes still significantly improved. This suggests that the proposed teaching model promotes more conscious learning. These results can be used as a reference for improving student learning outcomes and experiences with computer-assisted learning systems.},

Individually-paced electronic tutoring is potentially an effective way of meeting the students' varied learning needs within the limited time available for content teaching in the pedagogically focused course. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected in the forms of engagement patterns, surveys, focus-group discussions, and pre- and post- test scores. These were used to formulate a rich description in answer to the questions ?Is deep learning evident when student teachers engage with a module on density using conceptual tutoring software?,? and ?What design features of this module are effective in promoting deep learning?.? The findings suggest that conceptual tutoring software can be effective in promoting deep learning among student teachers. The sub-step design, branched structure, and conceptual approaches used in the tutoring design, and the inclusion of a written task and a test, were found to be effective in promoting deep learning.},

The students? temporal learning traces were used to extract the features used in the prediction models. The study participants were 51 students enrolled in the Database Management Systems course, which was conducted online using the Moodle learning management system. The study compared the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting students? academic procrastination tendencies, analysed the important features of prediction models, and examined whether there is a difference between the academic performance of low and high academic procrastinators. Logistic regression was found to outperform other classification algorithms and reached 90\% accuracy in classifying low and high academic procrastinators. Students? regular and early access to course activities were found to be important features in predicting their academic procrastination tendencies. In terms of academic performance, the findings support the existing literature. Students with low academic procrastination tendencies got significantly higher final grades than those with high academic procrastination tendencies. These findings show that students? academic procrastination tendencies can be predicted with high accuracy using online learning trajectories. Such a model will be important in the development of intervention methods for preventing academic procrastination.},

The participants were 115 undergraduates who were randomly divided into two groups. Students in the comparison group engaged in Jigsaw learning activities in the classroom, while the experimental group used a weblogging system during parts of the cooperative processes. Two findings were found. (1) Weblogs with Jigsaw cooperative learning activities, promoted better social interactions than those found in the comparison group. (2) RSS feeds and keyword searches made important contributions to cooperative learning, more than had been previously identified in the literature. These two components were found to alleviate cognitive overload and the consequences of time lag. Consequently, this study provides new insights into the role of weblogging in higher education.},

The aim of this study was to understand what type of learning situations trigger affective states in collaborative groups, and how these affective states are related to group members? physiological activation. The participants were 12-year-old primary school students (N = 31, 10 groups) performing a collaborative science task. In the analysis, video data observations were combined with data of group members? physiological activation. The groups? situational valence was identified based on the group members? observed emotional expressions and their physiological activation levels were measured with electrodermal activity (EDA). Results revealed that situations with group members? simultaneous physiological activation were rare compared with the observable emotional expressions. However, when group members indicated physiological activation simultaneously, they also showed visible emotional expressions more often than in deactivating situations. Moreover, the results showed that socially-related factors were more likely to trigger physiological activation with a mixed group level valence. In turn, task-related factors were more likely to trigger physiological activation with a neutral group level valence. The results of this study imply that by combining different process data modalities revealing the different components of affect, it might be possible to track emotionally meaningful situations that shape the course of the collaborative learning process.},

The results show design as a top-down iterative process, beginning with a broad framework to which detail is added through cycles of elaboration. Design extends over the period before, while, and after a unit is taught, demonstrating the dynamic nature of design and highlighting the importance of reflection in teachers' design practice. We present a descriptive model of the design process, which we relate to conceptualizations of higher education teaching and learning, and compare with the characteristics of general design and instructional design.

While multiuser VR is often deployed in a variety of digital educational settings, it has not been meaningfully explored in emergency medicine. This study was conducted to fill this research gap by developing a multi-user VR training system for the donning and doffing procedures associated with Level C protective gear. Furthermore, the current investigation also considered the determinants influencing whether emergency medical technicians are willing to adopt and accept multi-user VR training courses via conceptualizing the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. An empirical survey was conducted involving 80 emergency medical technicians in the eastern region of Taiwan to evaluate their experiences with the multi-user VR system. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, and the results showed that performance expectancy, social impact, facilitating conditions, price value, and habit significantly influenced emergency medical technicians? readiness to adopt multi-user VR training courses. Moreover, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and behavioral intention emerged as pivotal determinants of course adoption. However, effort expectancy and hedonic motivation did not exert a significant influence on adoption behavior. The findings of the study have important theoretical and practical implications.},

Although an adaptive gaming experience provides personalization to learning, the complexity of design makes it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness. In this systematic review, we adopt three analytic approaches: (1) bibliometric analysis, (2) qualitative thematic analysis, and (3) meta-analysis. We identified 62 relevant publications and used bibliometric analysis to visualize the hidden conceptual structure among the articles. We then used thematic analysis to investigate the emerging themes in the research and inform the coding for meta-analysis. Twelve articles that used experimental designs were further screened to model the effect of adding adaptivity to educational games. We found that an adaptive learning condition does not produce a substantial overall effect compared to a non-adaptive condition (g = .11, p = .26). Furthermore, moderator analysis reveals that the design variability of adaptivity does not contribute as much to heterogeneity as hypothesized. However, the effect size is positive when the target outcome focuses on learning (g = .39, p {\textless}. 001) and engagement (g = .41, p = .13). The effect size is negative when the target outcome focuses on game performance (g = -.27, p = .04). In addition, we find evidence for a potential publication bias based on the distribution of effect sizes.},

The current work strongly recommends the importance of a more systematic promotion of Internet safety awareness in primary schools as most Greek teachers seem to luck the basic pedagogical skills for exploring Cyberspace alongside their students, and giving worldly guidance and wisdom screen-by-screen.},

	abstract = {Researchers have more often examined whether students prefer using an e-textbook over a paper textbook or whether e-textbooks provide a better resource for learning than paper textbooks, but students' adoption of mark-up tools has remained relatively unexamined. Drawing on the concept of Innovation Diffusion Theory, we used educational data mining techniques and survival analysis to examine time to adoption of highlights, notes, annotations, bookmarks, and questions in an interactive e-textbook reader. We found that the only tool that more than half of the participants used was highlighting. Students who purchased a printed copy of the textbook had longer average times to using notes and annotations. Because most of the more interactive tools were used by a relatively small number of students, regression modeling of the factors associated with tool usage was difficult. However, there was evidence that the likelihood of using the tools decreased as the semester progressed, and that students' self-reported reading behaviors and grade point average were predictive of the time to using the mark-up tools. An interaction between bookmark usage and amount of reading was positively associated with course grades, suggesting that a strategy of bookmarking with frequent reading could assist students to learn content successfully. The implications of this research are that (1) instructors may need to more directly scaffold the adoption of interactive e-textbook tools that are touted as boosts to student learning and (2) promoting adoption early, shortly after students begin reading the e-textbook, is critical for students to acclimate to using the tool.},

The overarching purpose of this chapter is to explore and document the growth and development of the science of learning using a tripartite approach. The authors first provide an overview of definitions of learning that have been forwarded in the extant literature, with particular emphasis on journals published by the American Educational Research Association. Next, they overview the epistemic frames that have undergirded investigations of learning during the past century. Finally, they explore the ways in which the nature of investigations of learning has transitioned over time and how these transitions have manifested themselves in settings such as classrooms. In reflecting on the maturation and adaptation of the science of learning over the past century, the authors conclude with thoughts on the future of the science of learning.},

For abstract cognitive processes, animations might be beneficial, especially when a supportive pedagogical agent provides explanations. This article argues that animated models can be an effective instructional method, provided that they are designed in such a way that cognitive capacity is optimally employed. This review proposes three sets of design guidelines based on cognitive load research: The first aims at managing the complexity of subject matter. The second focuses on preventing activities (attributed to poor design) that obstruct learning. The last incites learners to engage in the active and relevant processing of subject matter. Finally, an integrative framework is presented for designing effective animated models.},

In this paper, we draw from years of research on whistle-blowing by social scientists and legal scholars and offer concrete suggestions to managers who are interested in encouraging internal reporting of problems requiring attention, and to observers of questionable activity who are considering reporting it. We also identify ways that research suggests policy-makers can have a more positive influence. We hope that these suggestions will help foster evidence-based practice regarding whistle-blowing.},

Analyses included comparisons of gain scores as a function of the learning context and as a function of the time reported using French outside of class. The main findings that reached statistical significance include: (a) The IM group made significant gains in oral performance in terms of the total number of words spoken, in length of the longest turn, in rate of speech, and in speech fluidity based on a composite of fluidity measures. When compared to the AH group, the SA group made statistically significant gains only in terms of speech fluidity but fewer gains than the IM group. The AH group made no significant gains, (b) The IM students reported that they spoke and wrote French significantly more hours per week than the other two groups. The SA group reported using English more than French (although the difference was not statistically significant) and reported using significantly more English in out-of-class activities than the IM group, (c) Multiple regression analyses revealed that reported hours per week spent writing outside of class was significantly associated with oral fluidity gains.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted by members of a site of the California Writing Project in partnership with a large, urban, low-SES school district where 93\% of the students speak English as a second language and 69\% are designated Limited English Proficient. Over an eight-year period, a relatively stable group of 55 secondary teachers engaged in ongoing professional development implemented a cognitive strategies approach to reading and writing instruction, making visible for approximately 2000 students per year the thinking tools experienced readers and writers access in the process of meaning construction. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of this approach on the reading and writing abilities of English language learners (ELLs) in all 13 secondary schools in the district. Students receiving cognitive strategies instruction significantly out-gained peers on holistically scored assessments of academic writing for seven consecutive years. Treatment-group students also performed significantly better than control-group students on GPA, standardized tests, and high-stakes writing assessments. Findings reinforce the importance of having high expectations for ELLs; exposing them to a rigorous language arts curriculum; explicitly teaching, modeling and providing guided practice in a variety of strategies to help students read and write about challenging texts; and involving students as partners in a community of learners. What distinguishes the project is its integrity with respect to its fidelity to three core dimensions: Teachers and students were exposed to an extensive set of cognitive strategies and a wide array of curricular approaches to strategy use (comprehensiveness) in a manner designed to cultivate deep knowledge and application of those strategies in reading and writing (density) over an extended period of time (duration). The consistency of positive outcomes on multiple measures strongly points to the efficacy of using this approach with ELLs.},

This recent scientific enterprise investigates whether and how different aspects of second language instruction may change both the anatomy and the functioning of an adult learner?s brain even in a short period of time. In this article, I analyse how neurolinguists have operationalized three aspects specifically related to second language teaching: (1) learners? proficiency; (2) the between-groups experimental design; (3) the implicit vs. explicit teaching dichotomy. I suggest that the degree of replicability of such neurolinguistics studies can be increased by adopting non-circular operational definitions. Such definitions should not be based on psycholinguistic or neurolinguistic metrics, but on standards that are commonly discussed in the literature on instructed second language acquisition, second language teaching, and assessment. Finally, I suggest that for future research neurolinguists should consider the advantages of welcoming on board more developmental linguists and teachers.},

Moreover, some have raised concerns as to whether commonly used approaches to ESL writing pedagogy and grammar instruction are effective in helping students improve their linguistic accuracy. This article describes an instructional strategy we developed for improving students' accuracy based on insights gleaned from practice, research, and theory. We refer to this instructional methodology as dynamic WCF. The article also discusses a test of the methodology's efficacy that compared the performance of two groups of students, one using a conventional process approach to writing instruction and the other using the dynamic WCF approach. Test results demonstrated that although rhetorical competence, writing fluency, and writing complexity were largely unaffected by the dynamic WCF pedagogy, significant improvement was observed for writing accuracy.},

	abstract = {We conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the construct validity of self-assessments of knowledge in education and workplace training. Self-assessment's strongest correlations were with motivation and satisfaction, two affective evaluation outcomes. The relationship between self-assessment and cognitive learning was moderate. Even under conditions that optimized the self-assessment—cognitive learning relationship (e.g., when learners practiced self-assessing and received feedback on their self-assessments), the relationship was still weaker than the self-assessment—motivation relationship. We also examined how researchers interpreted self-assessed knowledge, and discovered that nearly a third of evaluation studies interpreted self-assessed knowledge data as evidence of cognitive learning. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for evaluation practice that involve a more limited role for self-assessment.},

Planned contrasts revealed that the add-1 conditions were more effective than regular instruction/practice in promoting the learning of the add-1 rule.

The control participants did not exhibit evidence of learning a general near-doubles reasoning strategy (if 4 + 4 is 8 and 4 + 5 = 4 + 4 + 1, then the sum of 4 + 5 must be 9). The add-1, but not the active-control, participants achieved success, including transfer, because the former had mastered the developmental prerequisites for add-1 rule and the latter had not mastered the prerequisites for the near-doubles strategy.},

	abstract = {This paper considers how implicit and explicit knowledge are dissociable but cooperative. It reviews various psychological and neurobiological processes by which explicit knowledge of form-meaning associations impacts upon implicit language learning. The interface is dynamic: It happens transiently during conscious processing, but the influence upon implicit cognition endures thereafter. The primary conscious involvement in SLA is the explicit learning involved in the initial registration of pattern recognizers for constructions that are then tuned and integrated into the system by implicit learning during subsequent input processing. Neural systems in the prefrontal cortex involved in working memory provide attentional selection, perceptual integration, and the unification of consciousness. Neural systems in the hippocampus then bind these disparate cortical representations into unitary episodic representations. These are the mechanisms by which Schmidt's (1990) noticing helps solve Quine's (1960) problem of referential indeterminacy. Explicit memories can also guide the conscious building of novel linguistic utterances through processes of analogy. Formulas, slot-and-frame patterns, drills, and declarative pedagogical grammar rules all contribute to the conscious creation of utterances whose subsequent usage promotes implicit learning and proceduralization. Flawed output can prompt focused feedback by way of recasts that present learners with psycholinguistic data ready for explicit analysis. Other processes of acquisition from output include differentiation, analysis, and preemption. These processes of conscious construction in working memory underpin relationships between individual differences in working memory capacities and language learning aptitude.},

Twenty native speakers and 92 Japanese college students of English completed a computerized listening task measuring ability to comprehend two types of implied meaning in dialogues: indirect refusals (k = 24) and indirect opinions (k = 24). The participants' comprehension was analyzed for accuracy (scores on the listening task) and comprehension speed (average time taken to answer each item correctly). L2 learners' accuracy and comprehension speed improved significantly over a 7-week period. However, the magnitude of effect was lower for comprehension speed than for accuracy. This study also examined the relationships among general L2 proficiency (measured on the ITP TOEFL), speed of lexical judgment (measured on a word recognition task), and pragmatic comprehension ability. There was a significant relationship between proficiency and accuracy (r = 0.39), as well as between lexical access speed and comprehension speed (r = 0.40). However, L2 proficiency bore no relationship to comprehension speed, and lexical access speed had no relationship with accuracy. Moreover, accuracy and comprehension speed were not related to each other. These findings suggest that development of pragmatic knowledge and processing capacity of using the knowledge may not coincide perfectly in L2 development.},

To investigate why such an association is observed, this study examined the influence of inherent aspect and learners' first language (L1) tasks?an acceptability judgment test and an oral picture description task?with two groups of second language learners of Japanese: 26 native speakers (NSs) of English, which has the obligatory progressive, and 35 NSs of languages that have no obligatory progressive marking (German and Slavic languages). The results from the acceptability judgment test support the aspect hypothesis in that, regardless of L1, the imperfective marker -te i-ru was strongly associated with activity verbs for lower proficiency learners. However, the results from the oral task did not support the prediction, in that lower proficiency L1 nonprogressive learners did not show any such preference.The results suggest that L1 plays a role in the formation of the acquisition pattern predicted by the aspect hypothesis, but that given the complex interaction with task types and proficiency, L1 transfer cannot be the sole reason for the predicted association in the acquisition of Japanese -te i-(ru). It is argued that multiple factors are at work when learners create the form-meaning associations predicted by the aspect hypothesis.},

This study, with 141 boys and girls in the fourth and fifth grades in the United States, examined the effects of virtual-peer presence (presence, absence, and control) on learners' text comprehension and also the effects of learner gender and virtual-peer attributes (human-like male, human-like female, robot still image) on learners' perceptions of their peer and on their text comprehension. The results revealed that the virtual-peer presence group outperformed both the absence group and the control group in the immediate and delayed posttests text comprehension. There were mixed results in the impacts of learner gender and virtual-peer attributes on text comprehension. The learners' perceptions of their agent were not differentiated by neither learner gender nor virtual-peer attributes. The findings are discussed with virtual-peer design implications.},

This app is designed (1) as an effective support tool for EFL speaking in authentic contexts and (2) to engage students in exercise as they walk in their environment. Results suggest that using ezTranslate in familiar situations significantly promotes student cooperation, as evidenced by their increased listening and speaking. Furthermore, there were significant differences in English speaking performance and homework aptitude in participants when using ezTranslate with or without authentic contexts. Indeed, this study?s findings emphasize the importance of authentic support for EFL speaking; namely, students? interests. The familiarity and fascination of students with real contexts can motivate them to communicate in English better and more frequently. As for the effect of exercise on EFL learning, statistical analysis revealed that the more steps students take, the more they practice speaking English. These results are very promising. Creating an interactive medium in which students not only acquire knowledge but also move their bodies promotes brain and body activity vital to their overall health. In the near future, we plan to extend activity design, executing authentic drama-play to sustain effective, healthy EFL learning.},

The findings indicate that institutional pedagogy is driven generally by regulated knowledge sources, knowledge dissemination, student compliance, parental expectations, examination achievement and pastoral care. The academics were enthusiastic about introducing more interactive, self-paced, authentic and web-based pedagogy, but continually indicated how traditional practice, social expectations, local regulations and economic restraints would frustrate reforming practices. The findings also show how pedagogic reform confronts existing subjectivity, and emphasise the importance of building and disseminating a rationale for changing prior to any pedagogic innovation. The Activity Theory framework demonstrates how potential pedagogic change has to be preceded by changing the understanding of stakeholders about the new goals and practices of learning.

It reports on the processes and learning outcomes for thirty students who built a wiki, and engaged in other collaborative and active-learning exercises, to develop content knowledge in French. This approach provides an authentic and meaningful language learning setting and integrates technology-assisted collaborative learning in syllabus design from the outset. Post-course evaluations indicate that students developed a sense of class community through the collaborative approach and felt engaged with course content. This exploratory, qualitative project also provides insight on the importance of continuous critical instructor feedback for optimal quality of student output and of a system encouraging and controlling equal participation of students. The study suggests that the ?read-and-write?

This required us to discover utterly novel data sources, suitable to inform policy makers about changes regarding not only scientific results, but also attitudes, perceptions and behavior (ultimately, the Worldview) of scientists and researchers. The paper results with a proposal of a new social metrology model inspired by principles of the complexity theory and potentially capable of moving the whole process from aggregated macro statistics to smaller details, adjusted to the circumstances of the scientific communities. The novel, complexity-based model for measuring scientific human and social capital is explained through its seven main constructs (performances, metaphor, contexts, cultural, community, sustainable development and the Worldview) with belonging quality indicators and related stakeholders.},

We therefore write this commentary to call upon information systems scholars to investigate the design and use of gamified information systems from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and theories, including behavioral economics, psychology, social psychology, information systems, etc. We first explicate the idea of gamified information systems, provide real-world examples of successful and unsuccessful systems, and, based on a synthesis of the available literature, present a taxonomy of gamification design elements. We then develop a framework for research and design: its main theme is to create meaningful engagement for users; that is, gamified information systems should be designed to address the dual goals of instrumental and experiential outcomes. Using this framework, we develop a set of design principles and research questions, using a running case to illustrate some of our ideas. We conclude with a summary of opportunities for IS researchers to extend our knowledge of gamified information systems, and, at the same time, advance existing theories.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Researchers studying processes of global environmental change are increasingly interested in their work having impacts that go beyond academia to influence policy and management. Recent scholarship in the conservation sciences has pointed to the existence of a research-action gap and has proposed various solutions for overcoming it. However, most of these studies have been limited to the spaces of dissemination, where the science has already been done and is then to be passed over to users of the information. Much less attention has been paid to encounters that occur between scientists and nonscientists during the practice of doing scientific research, especially in situations that include everyday roles of labor and styles of communication (i.e., fieldwork). This paper builds on theories of contact that have examined encounters and relations between different groups and cultures in diverse settings. I use quantitative and qualitative evidence from Madidi National Park, Bolivia, including an analysis of past research in the protected area, as well as interviews (N = 137) and workshops and focus groups (N = 12) with local inhabitants, scientists, and park guards. The study demonstrates the significance of currently unacknowledged or undervalued components of the research-action gap, such as power, respect, and recognition, to develop a relational and reciprocal notion of impact. I explain why, within such spaces of encounter or misencounter between scientists and local people, knowledge can be exchanged or hidden away, worldviews can be expanded or further entrenched, and scientific research can be welcomed or rejected.},

However, we point out the irony that university faculty, those who are usually on the cutting edge of leadership scholarship and who are also in an excellent position to apply the findings from this research, seem not to be doing this. It appears that, as they say, the "cobbler's children have no shoes." After disentangling some of the possible reasons for this, we observe that as university educators, we might want to remedy this curious state of affairs by turning to empirically valid models of how to transform organizations so that we really are capable of transforming our students into leaders.},

In the past few years, however, there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant organizational resource. Consistent with the interest in organizational knowledge and knowledge management (KM), IS researchers have begun promoting a class of information systems, referred to as knowledge management systems (KMS). The objective of KMS is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in organizations. Knowledge and knowledge management are complex and multi-faceted concepts. Thus, effective development and implementation of KMS requires a foundation in several rich literatures. To be credible, KMS research and development should preserve and build upon the significant literature that exists in different but rzelated fields. This paper provides a review and interpretation of knowledge management literatures in different fields with an eye toward identifying the important areas for research. We present a detailed process view of organizational knowledge management with a focus on the potential role of information technology in this process. Drawing upon the literature review and analysis of knowledge management processes, we discuss several important research issues surrounding the knowledge management processes and the role of IT in support of these processes.},

Relying on an empirically derived competency model from 8,633 incumbent managers across 52 managerial occupations, our results showed that behavioral competencies indicated by managers to be most critical are the very competencies least represented in required MBA curricula. Findings further indicate that institutional factors such as media rankings and mission orientation have no effect on the alignment of MBA curricula with critical managerial competencies.},

	abstract = {This article identifies five categories of resources that preservice teachers drew on as they considered student writing and planned their own approaches to assessing and teaching writing. Identifying these resources helps us better understand how beginning writing teachers think about student writing—and better understand mismatches that commonly occur between what teacher educators teach and what new teachers actually do. Our study builds on literature that considers how writing teachers are prepared, extends research about how preservice teachers use what they learn, and adds layers of detail to literature about the resources that beginning teachers draw upon to aid and support them in their work. The pedagogical and research projects described in this study stem from a communities-of-practice framework. Our methods surfaced preservice teachers' claims about writing and the resources they drew upon to support those claims. Drawing upon our rhetorical view of writing, we worked inductively to identify these claims and resources, using grounded analysis of transcripts from preservice teachers' VoiceThread conversations to develop a taxonomy of 15 resources grouped into 5 categories: understanding of students and student writing; knowledge of context; colleagues; roles; and writing. This research has implications for educators and researchers working in teacher preparation. Scaffolded instruction is essential to help beginning teachers use particular resources—and to employ resources in ways connected with rhetorical conceptual frameworks. To that end, the taxonomy of resources can be used as a tool for individual and programmatic assessment, as well as to facilitate scaffolded instruction.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Landscape design is a conservation planning process, described in the landscape ecology literature, proposed to rectify the knowledge and implementation gap in planning that have limited the effectiveness of many conservation planning efforts. Use of landscape design bridges this gap through increased emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of conservation planning and engagement of a stakeholder advisory team to create a conservation plan that resonates with biological, cultural, social, and economic realities of the area concerned. We define landscape design as a conservation planning process that integrates societal goals and values with established biological conservation goals, using science grounded in landscape ecology to describe future scenarios where specific and measurable biological goals can be attained. First, we describe a landscape design process and provide examples from the literature and partnerships such as Connect the Connecticut and the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative. We follow by discussing a case study of a landscape design effort to conserve playa wetlands to support waterfowl goals for migrating waterfowl established in the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. We further highlight characteristics of a successfully completed landscape design. We conclude that landscape design is a powerful process that goes beyond identifying high-priority conservation assets and intended to be an action-oriented process. Landscape design provides a framework for ensuring that conservation planning does not occur in a vacuum by ensuring social, cultural, and economic needs of people are recognized before valuable conservation dollars are expended. It provides a mechanism for understanding the effects of future landscape drivers on natural resources and engages stakeholders in proactive discussions regarding conservation. The final result is a commitment by a partnership to a set of actions that will achieve the stated conservation goal.},

We study three exemplar gaps using an extensive qualitative dataset, mainly in-depth interviews, in order to better understand why these gaps exist. Theory-practice gaps in listening, follow-up, and adaptability have not been empirically confirmed in light of rapid change in the sales field. After confirming these gaps, we explore antecedents, uncovering several underlying reasons for gap formation. We consider theoretical and managerial implications. In particular, we elaborate on the need for theory to be more relevant and contextualized.},

First, to offer a critical review of the literatures on two wellknown single-component solutions to the problem of a gap between moral knowledge and moral action: moral identity and moral emotions. Second, to take seriously the rising interest in Aristotle-inspired virtue ethics and character development within the social sciences: approaches that seem to assume that the development of phronesis (practical wisdom) bridges the gap in question. Since phronesis is a multicomponent construct, the latter part of this article offers an overview of what those different components would be, as a necessary precursor to operationalising them if the phronesis hypothesis were to be subjected to empirical scrutiny. The idea of a neo-Aristotelian multicomponent solution to the ?gappiness problem? invites comparisons with another multicomponent candidate, the neo-Kohlbergian four-component model, with which it shares at least surface similarities. Some space is thus devoted to the proposed theoretical uniqueness of a phronesis-based multicomponent model vis-�-vis the neo-Kohlbergian one. Our main conclusion is that ? weaknesses in its developmental psychological grounding notwithstanding ? operationalising the phronesis model for the purposes of instrument design and empirical inquiry would be a feasible and potentially productive enterprise.},

However, this has proven especially difficult, as good intentions do not always translate into ethical awareness and action. Complementing a behavioral ethics approach with insights from social psychology, we developed an interventional class module with both online and in-class elements aimed at increasing students' awareness of their own susceptibility to unconscious biases and, consequently, unethical behaviors. We deployed this intervention within a problem-based learning course (137 undergraduate students), in which students completed real-world projects for actual business clients. Our results suggest that although students appeared universally aware of the importance of ethical issues in business and generally espoused intentions to act ethically, those who received the intervention were significantly more likely to recognize their own susceptibility to perpetuating unethical business behavior and to identify ethical issues specific to their real-world projects. These results have important implications for behavioral ethics pedagogy and provide a de-biasing interventional approach for bridging classroom knowledge with real-world skills.},

The perspectives of health care leaders on these policy changes have been studied, but the perspectives of CBO managers have not. Methods: Our research question was: How are CBOs in Massachusetts perceiving and responding to new Medicaid policies that encourage collaboration between health care organizations and CBOs? We interviewed 46 people in leadership positions at CBOs in Massachusetts for approximately an hour each. We analyzed these data abductively, meaning that we iterated between inductively coding transcripts and consulting existing theories and frameworks. Findings: We found evidence of a knowing-doing gap among CBOs. Even though CBOs value their distinctiveness and autonomy from health care, they have undertaken a series of organizational changes in response to the new Medicaid policy that make their organizations appear more like health care organizations. These changes include adopting new performance metrics, hiring clinical staff to the board and senior management positions, and using medical language to describe nonmedical work. Drawing on institutional theory, we suggest that the nonprofits undertake such changes in an effort to demonstrate legitimacy to health care organizations, who may be able to provide new sources of critically needed revenue. Conclusions: Massachusetts CBOs perceive health systems as potential sources of revenue, due in part to an ongoing Medicaid redesign that encourages the integration of health and social services. This perception is driving CBOs to appear more like health care organizations, but the impacts of these changes on welfare remain unknown.},

The once accepted Harvard model of capstone integration and learning-by-doing through case discussion is now much less in vogue. Consequently, strategy students today tend to experience a rather abstract approach to learning about strategy presented through the limited prism of a theoretical discipline. Even classroom discussions of cases are often guided by instructors to confirm the utility of a particular theoretical framework, instead of serving as an open-ended discussion of problems and solutions. After presenting our evidence and arguments against the current trend, we present some examples of MBA programs that give more emphasis to practice, including USC's Executive MBA program, where priority is placed on integration and implementation without sacrificing, we believe, essential theories and analytical skills. Finally, we explore the implications from our analysis for additional solutions in other strategy teaching contexts.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. The gap between scientific knowledge and implementation in the fields of biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and climate change adaptation has resulted in many calls from practitioners and academics to provide practical solutions responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global environmental change, e.g., Future Earth. We present a framework to guide the implementation of science-action partnerships based on a real-world case study of a partnership between a local municipality and an academic institution to bridge the science-action gap in the eThekwini Municipal Area, South Africa. This partnership aims to inform the implementation of sustainable land-use planning, biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and climate change adaptation practice and contributes to the development of human capacity in these areas of expertise. Using a transdisciplinary approach, implementation-driven research is being conducted to develop several decision-making products to better inform land-use planning and management. Lessons learned through this partnership are synthesized and presented as a framework of enabling actions operating at different levels, from the individual to the interorganizational. Enabling actions include putting in place enabling organizational preconditions, assembling a functional well-structured team, and actively building interpersonal and individual collaborative capacity. Lessons learned in the case study emphasize the importance of building collaborative capacity and social capital, and paying attention to the process of transdisciplinary research to achieve more tangible science, management, and policy objectives in science-action partnerships. By documenting and reflecting on the process, this case study provides conceptual and practical guidance on bridging the science-action gap through partnerships.},

We describe "Project Ulysses," an integrated service-learning program which involves sending participants in teams to developing countries to work in cross-sector partnerships with NGOs, social entrepreneurs, or international organizations. In order to understand how Ulysses participants learn from their experiences while abroad, we interviewed 70 participants and content-analyzed the learning narratives that they produced. We found evidence of learning in six areas: responsible mind-set, ethical literacy, cultural intelligence, global mind-set, self-development, and community building. We also identified a number of processes through which learning occurred at the cognitive, affective, and behavioral levels, including the process of resolving cultural and ethical paradoxes; constructing a new lifeworld, that is, developing a new perspective of self and the world; and making sense of the emotions experienced while on assignment. The results of a postprogram survey confirm the long-term effectiveness of Ulysses in developing and enhancing competencies that are critical for responsible global leadership. We discuss the implications for theory building on responsible leadership and helping organizations leverage the potential of international servicelearning programs for developing responsible global leaders.},

Capitalizing on this dynamic resource for enterprise performance depends upon its rapid and reliable flows across people, organizations, locations, and times of application. From a technological perspective, this points immediately to the design of information systems to enhance knowledge flows. The problem is, the design of information systems to enhance knowledge flows requires new understanding. The research described in this paper concentrates on understanding the dynamics of knowledge phenomenologically and on developing and applying techniques for modeling and visualizing dynamic knowledge flows and stocks. We draw key, theoretical concepts from multiple literatures, and we build upon integrative modeling work that composes a parsimonious, multidimensional, analytical framework for representing and visualizing dynamic knowledge. We then conduct field research to learn how this theoretical framework may be used to model knowledge flows in practice. By focusing this empirical work on an extreme organization and processes that involve and rely upon tacit knowledge, we illustrate how dynamic knowledge patterns can inform design in new ways. New chunks of kernel theory deriving from this fieldwork are articulated in terms of a propositional model, which provides a basis for the development of testable design theory hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Due to the low ratio of medical decisions made upon solid scientific evidence (4\%) and the low efficiency of deploying knowledge in practice (17 years), the concept of a learning health system (LHS) was initiated to speed up knowledge generation and adoption and systematically approach continuous improvement in clinical practice. This concept can be illustrated by a so-called learning health cycle. This cycle, the first version as well as its variants, provides a framework for discussion on a common basis and has been well-accepted by the medical communities. Though the idea attracted major attention widely, very little has been done in way of actual adoption in real practices in the past 10 years. Nevertheless, as one of the pioneers in Taiwan, we have been involved in the effort to implement the LHS locally since 2016. In this article, we systematically summarize the evolution of the learning health cycle, review cases of its applications and briefly introduce the work we have done for promoting LHSs in Taiwan. Based on the experience we have gained, we try to identify the challenges and opportunities in Taiwan. While full-scale electronic medical records powered by the National Health Insurance system give Taiwan a special advantage in achieving a nationwide LHS, the medical community is not yet ready for a dramatic change. The lack of infrastructure for this use and motivation to take action right away makes the implementation of a LHS in Taiwan challenging.},

	abstract = {Environmental decision-makers and practitioners need and deserve high-quality environmental evidence for effective decision-making. We collate and share a suite of best practices for applied environmental researchers to support their capacity to inform such decision-making processes. This raises a number of important questions: What does ?relevant? and informative evidence look like? How do we know when evidence has been applied? We assembled an experienced team of knowledge generators and users in Canada to identify insights that have emerged from their work and that could serve as guideposts for others who seek to apply environmental research to policy challenges. By reflecting on successes and failures, we define ?success? in applied environmental science as respectfully conducted, partner-relevant research that is accessible, understandable, and shared and that can create opportunities for change (e.g., in policy, behaviour, management). Next, we generated a list of best practices for delivering ?successful? applied environmental research. Our guidance emphasizes the importance of engaging early and often, in a respectful manner, with partners, generating high-quality, relevant research (which requires flexibility), having a plan for communicating and sharing outputs, and being transparent about uncertainties and limitations. Other important considerations include acknowledging partners for involvement and training early career researchers in applied partnership research. Finally, we generated a list of specific, measurable indicators for evaluating success, including quality and quantity of scientific outputs, the relationship with the partner(s), relevance and connectedness of the research, accessibility and availability of outputs to users, provision of outputs that are digestible and usable by different audiences,training and capacity building, and ultimate outcomes (e.g., including social, environmental, and economic outcomes, as well as partner satisfaction). We encourage those embarking on applied environmental research to consider embracing the strategies, to continuously reflect on progress toward shared research goals, and to be flexible. Doing so will increase the likelihood of delivering research that is ?successful? and in doing so contribute to overcoming and addressing environmental issues and problems.

We find that knowledge transfers from customers and suppliers are positively related to innovativeness, which has a significant influence on firm performance. The results also show that knowledge transfers from suppliers (only) influence knowledge quality, and knowledge transfer from suppliers, in turn, has an indirect effect on innovation through knowledge quality. Thus, the results underscore the importance of knowledge transfers from suppliers to knowledge quality and knowledge transfers from suppliers through knowledge quality for achieving innovation. The results also underline the need to distinguish knowledge transfers from specific actors, in order to understand the influence of knowledge quality on external knowledge transfers and innovation, adding to research into the conditions under which external knowledge transfers contribute to innovation and firm performance.},

We examine the cognitive efforts of senior decision makers of an inexperienced multinational, as they assessed a potential acquisition in a politically hazardous African country.

We argue that executive education is an underutilized context that can enhance the quality of faculty research as well as our impact on managerial practice. Using evaluation data from variations of a single executive education program, we find that action-learning programs significantly enhance both individual and organizational outcomes compared to traditional executive education formats. Action-learning programs also enhance our teaching and research efforts.

Here we turn to an important piece of the puzzle that has been undertheorized: laypeople's beliefs about the nature of networks. Borrowing from the literature on lay theories in motivational psychology, we examine the effects of how laypeople construe different components of networks—individuals and their social intelligence, social relations, and social capital—as relatively fixed or malleable. We explain how each belief affects people's attitudes toward both the utility and morality of networking, with consequences for their engagement in different forms of networking (searching for new ties, maintaining existing ties, and leveraging social capital). We also consider these beliefs' downstream consequences for the size, diversity, and cohesiveness of networks people build. Overall, by examining the role of domain-specific beliefs and attitudes that undermine people's motivation to network, our model departs from existing views of networking based on rationality, personality, and perception to shed new light on the motivational psychology of networking.},

	abstract = {Background: Knowledge management (KM) is the process by which people in organizations find, share, and develop knowledge for action. KM affects performance by influencing work relationships to enhance learning and decision making. Purpose: To identify how family medicine practices exhibit KM. Methodology: A model and a template of KM concepts were derived from a comprehensive organizational literature review. Two higher and two lower performing family medicine practices were purposefully selected from existing comparative case studies based on prevention delivery rates and innovation. Interviews, fieldnotes of operations, and clinical encounters were coded independently using the template. Face-to-face discussions resolved coding differences. Findings: All practices had processes and tools for finding, sharing, and developing knowledge; however, KM overall was limited despite implementation of expensive technologies like an electronic medical record. Where present, KM processes and tools were used by individuals but not integrated throughout the organization. Loss of information was prominent, and finding knowledge was underdeveloped. The use of technical tools and developing knowledge by reconfiguration and measurement were particularly limited. Socially related tools, such as face-to-face-communication for sharing and developing knowledge, were more developed. As in other organizations, tool use was tailored for specific outcomes and leveraged by other organizational capacities. Practice Implications: Differences in KM occur within family practices and between family practices and other organizations and may have implications for improving practice performance. Understanding interaction patterns of work relationships and KM may explain why costly technical or externally imposed "one size fits all" practice organizational interventions have had mixed results and limited sustainability.},

The program methodology was participatory, interactive and reflective, with mentoring support, exercises, group work and discussions as well as content pertinent to the needs of practice. The evaluation was quali-quantitative with an analysis of the student profile, the implementation process, outcomes at the end of the training and impacts on workplace changes. The results showed a high rate of student approval (87 and 76\%), good academic performance and a high level of satisfaction with the methodology and knowledge delivered. The participants? final projects were adapted to local work places realities and were implemented by 62.6\% of technicians and 43\% of professionals, in addition to changes in work practices that favor health promotion. The level of fulfillment of participants? expectations was very high and the most frequent barriers to implementing the final project were lack of time and personnel, along with minimal support from management and low prioritization of health promotion. This study shows the effectiveness of a distance training model for professionals and technicians that can reach the most remote parts of the country, where there is no access to presencial training, with an educational program centered on work activities and current health challenges.},

We used a participatory approach to develop complementary tangible and online interfaces for collaboratively forecasting biological invasions and devising control strategies. A diverse group of stakeholders evaluated both systems in the real-world context of controlling sudden oak death, an emerging forest disease killing millions of trees in California and Oregon. Our findings suggest that while both interfaces encouraged adaptive experimentation, tangible interfaces are particularly well suited to support collaborative decision-making.

Although climate adaptation takes place when cities replace critical infrastructure damaged by severe weather events, little is known about the influence of political affiliation and severe weather events on climate adaptation in a broader sense. Using multiple linear regression models, this study analyzes variations in local government climate adaptation efforts as a function of local gross domestic product (as a control variable), historical weather-related factors [i.e., number of extreme weather events, weather-related economic impact due to property damage, and weather-related human impact (injuries and fatalities)], and state and local political affiliation. The findings of this study indicate that local political affiliation significantly influences local government climate adaptation efforts; however, state political affiliation does not. Further, local weather-related impacts do not appear to affect the likelihood of local government to engage in climate adaptation efforts, even when accounting for potential interactions with local political affiliation. These results support the hypothesis that local political affiliation is a strong and robust predictor of local climate adaptation in U.S. cities. This study contributes to literature aimed at addressing the widely acknowledged need for understanding key barriers to U.S. climate adaptation, as well as the role of politics in moderating climate action.},

There is, however, no framework to assess the quality of these data, models, and approaches that takes into account the issues that arise when this information is produced. An evaluation of the quality of regional climate information is a fundamental requirement for its appropriate application in societal decision-making. Here, an analytical framework is constructed for the quality assessment of science-based statements and estimates about future climate. This framework targets statements that project local and regional climate at decadal and longer time scales. After identifying the main issues with evaluating and presenting regional climate information, it is argued that it is helpful to consider the quality of statements about future climate in terms of 1) the type of evidence and 2) the relationship between the evidence and the statement. This distinction not only provides a more targeted framework for quality, but also shows how certain evidential standards can change as a function of the statement under consideration. The key dimensions to assess regional climate information quality are diversity, completeness, theory, adequacy for purpose, and transparency. This framework is exemplified using two research papers that provide regional climate information and the implications of the framework are explored.},

We conducted an experiment to compare the effectiveness of a simulation vis-�-vis a case-based method to teach sustainable development.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Environmental problems caused by human activities are increasing; biodiversity is disappearing at an unprecedented rate, soils are being irreversibly damaged, freshwater is increasingly in short supply, and the climate is changing. To reverse or even to reduce these trends will require a radical transformation in the relationship between humans and the natural environment. Just how this can be achieved within, at most, a few decades is unknown, but it is clear that academia must play a crucial role. Many believe, however, that academic institutions need to become more effective in helping societies move toward sustainability. We first synthesize current thinking about this crisis of research effectiveness. We argue that those involved in producing knowledge to solve societal problems face three particular challenges: the complexity of real-world sustainability problems, maintaining impartiality when expert knowledge is used in decision making, and ensuring the salience of the scientific knowledge for decision makers. We discuss three strategies to meet these challenges: conducting research in interdisciplinary teams, forming research partnerships with actors and experts from outside academia, and framing research questions with the aim of solving specific problems (problem orientation). However, we argue that implementing these strategies within academia will require both cultural and institutional change. We then use concepts from transition management to suggest how academic institutions can make the necessary changes. At the level of system optimization, we call for: quality criteria, career incentives, and funding schemes that reward not only disciplinary excellence but also achievements in inter-/transdisciplinary work; professional services and training through specialized centers that facilitate problem-oriented research and reciprocal knowledge exchange with society; and the integration of sustainability and inter-/transdisciplinary research practices into all teaching curricula. At the level of system innovation, we propose radical changes in institutional structures, research and career incentives, teaching programs, and research partnerships. We see much value in a view of change that emphasizes the complementarity of system innovation and system optimization. The goal must be a process of change that preserves the traditional strengths of academic research, with its emphasis on disciplinary excellence and scientific rigor, while ensuring that institutional environments and the skills, worldviews, and experiences of the involved actors adapt to the rapidly changing needs of society.},

To better understand the mechanisms that support or inhibit the implementation of such innovations, we apply constructs from organizational learning theory to the case of implementing innovation in schools, and operationalize those constructs in a computational, agent-based model. Model analysis reveals how the misalignment between an organization's social network and the task structure of its target innovation can impede frontline implementation, even when the individuals inside the organization have the skill and willingness to implement the innovation's constituent activities. We find that individual-level improvement before the decision to adopt the innovation can exacerbate this problem by reducing the utilization of tasks needed to support future implementation. We translate our insights into specific propositions about how the work required by the target innovation and an organization's social network relate to the level of frontline implementation in organizations.},

This reality, coupled with the fact that organizational insiders control much of their organizations? valuable information, has led both researchers and practitioners to acknowledge the importance of insiders? behavior for information security. Until recently, researchers have employed only a few theories to understand these influences, and this has generated calls for a broadened theoretical repertoire. Given this opportunity, we incorporate the previously developed framework of emotions and add the broaden-and-build theory (BBT) to understand the influence of discrete positive and negative emotions on insiders? precaution-taking activities. Our findings demonstrate that the relationship between both positive and negative emotions and precaution taking is mediated by insiders?

Despite its importance, evidence suggests that many managers are often hesitant to solicit voice from their employees. We develop and test a new theory that seeks to explain this puzzling reluctance. Voice is a distinctive behavior that involves escalation of opinions, ideas, or concerns by employees to their managers with the expectation that they would respond by making systemic changes in their teams. Hence, we argue that managers are likely to solicit voice more when they perceive requisite discretion and influence (personal control) to effect changes in their teams. Additionally, because voice-driven change can cause short-term disruptions and bring about benefits typically only over time, we propose that managers act on their personal control to solicit more voice when they also possess adequate long-term orientation. We find support for our arguments across four studies using experimental as well as correlational methods. We discuss the conceptual and practical implications of our findings.},

To address this, a framework conceptualising autochthonous human adaptation to invasions was developed based on the Human Adaptation to Biodiversity Change framework and a case study metasynthesis. Results show that adaptation occurs within different spheres of human activity and organisation at different social-ecological scales; responses have feedbacks within and across these spheres. Adaptation to invasives and other drivers is a set of highly contextual, complex, non-linear responses that make up pathways pursued over time. Most invasive species management and adaptation occurs ?from below,? and policies and planned control efforts should support autochthonous adaptation, rather than undermining it.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence from recent curriculum documents and previous research suggests that reform-oriented science teaching practices promote students' conceptual understanding, levels of achievement, and motivation to learn, especially when students are actively engaged in constructing their ideas through scientific inquiries. However, it is difficult to identify to what extent science teachers engage students in reform-oriented teaching practices (RTPs) in their science classrooms. In order to exactly diagnose the current status of science teachers' implementation of the RTPs, a valid and reliable instrument tool is needed. The principles of validity and reliability are fundamental cornerstones in developing a robust measurement tool. As such, this study was motivated by the desire to point out the limitations of the existing statistical and psychometric analyses and to further examine the validation of the RTP survey instrument. This paper thus aims at calibrating the items of the RTPs for science teachers using the Rasch model. The survey instrument scale was adapted from the 2012 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education (NSSME) data. A total of 3701 science teachers from 1403 schools from across the USA participated in the NSSME survey. After calibrating the RTP items and persons on the same scale, the RTP instrument well represented the population of US science teachers. Model-data fit determined by Infit and Outfit statistics was within an appropriate range (0.5–1.5), supporting the unidimensional structure of the RTPs. The ordered category thresholds and the probability of the thresholds showed that the five-point rating scale functioned well. The results of this study support the use of the RTP measure from the 2012 NSSME in assessing usage of RTPs.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Management decisions for natural resources are not made in a vacuum; the environmental and ecological conditions as well as the socioeconomic and political contexts affect goals, the choice of interventions, their feasibility, and which outcomes are obtained. Although uncertainty is recognized as a feature of natural resource management, little attention has been given to the uncertainty generated by institutional settings, historical contingency, and individual people?s influence. These implementation uncertainties, related to the translation of policy into practice, make it difficult to predict the outcomes of management interventions within social?ecological systems. Using the conservation of species hunted for bushmeat in the Serengeti as a case study, we investigated the challenges and potential barriers to successful implementation of natural resource management policies. We used a mixed-methods approach, combining semistructured interviews with scenario building, social network, and institutional analysis exercises. Using a management strategy evaluation (MSE) conceptual framework, we obtained insights into the constraints and opportunities for fulfilling stakeholder aspirations for the social?ecological system, analyzed the multiple roles played by different institutions in the system, and described the interactions between different actor types. We found that the respondents had generally similar views about the current and future status of the Serengeti but disagreed about how to address issues of conservation concern and were more uncertain about the actual outcomes of management interventions. Improving conservation implementation (rather than research, monitoring, or status assessment) was perceived as the key priority to be addressed. Institutional barriers were perceived as an important challenge given that the decision-making and implementation processes were broadly distributed across a number of institutions. Conservation social networks were centered on very few individuals, suggesting their importance in bridging across conservation arenas but also potentially affecting the resilience of governance structures. Our study gives an improved understanding of the underlying causes of discrepancies between conservation plans and outcomes for this case study, as well as providing a novel framework for the analysis of implementation uncertainties more broadly. A next step would be to use this framework as a basis for collaboratively developed models that integrate research findings with specific management questions. By bringing tools and findings from social psychology, natural resource management, and bioeconomics together into a unified operational framework, researchers may be better able to understand the barriers to successful resource management and engage with stakeholders to overcome them.},

In addition, instructor, course, and institution-level characteristics were examined as potential correlates of references to EBM. Using a liberal operationalization of EBM (i.e., keywords or phrases that are consistent with evidence-based management principles), results suggest that approximately 25\% of core MBA management courses utilize EBM in some form. However, there are substantial differences across categories of course content and depending on whether the instructor has a PhD. Evidence-based management-consistent syllabi are most prevalent at the MBA level in organizational behavior and least in international management and entrepreneurship.

	abstract = {According to many, we live in an age in which convergence between formerly distinct national 'models' is taking place. Central to this process is a learning dynamic in which best practices originating from within one model ? Japan in the 1980s, United States in the 1990s ? are supposedly adopted by firms elsewhere. This paper addresses two key questions concerning this process. First, what are the actual mechanisms or processes through which this learning-driven convergence might occur? Second, what role do institutions play in shaping, influencing, or constraining firms' choice of practices and their ability to 'learn'? The paper examines eight specific channels of convergence representing a continuum of opportunities for learning-through-interacting. It then assesses critically a range of competing arguments about the role of institutional influences at three different scales: the region, the nation-state, and the firm. It concludes that while regional and firm-level arguments, on their own, do not provide an adequate explanatory framework for understanding how firms' practices are determined, national level theory needs to be made supple enough to accommodate a significant role for regional institutions and the agency of the firm.},

As a result, law firms must continue to attract, develop, and retain talented lawyers. Unfortunately, the traditional approach, which divides responsibility for professional development among law schools, which are supposed to teach students to think like a lawyer; law firms, which are expected to train associates to "be" lawyers; and corporate clients, whose job it is to foot the bill, is no longer well aligned to the current realities of the marketplace. In this Article, we document the causes for this misalignment and propose a new model of professional development in which law schools, law firms, and corporate clients collaborate to train lawyers to be lifelong learners in the full range of technical, professional, and network-building skills they will need to flourish throughout their careers. We offer specific proposals for how to achieve this realignment and confront the resistance that will inevitably greet any attempt to do so.},

To understand erosion, we study two software development organizations that experienced diverging capability trajectories despite similar organizational and technological settings. Building a simulation-based theory, we identify the adaptation trap, a mechanism through which managerial learning can lead to capability erosion: well-intentioned efforts by managers to search locally for the optimal workload balance lead them to systematically overload their organization and, thereby, cause capabilities to erode. The analysis of our model informs when capability erosion is likely and strategically relevant.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of the 6-PACK programme on falls and fall injuries in acute wards. DESIGN Cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING Six Australian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS All patients admitted to 24 acute wards during the trial period. INTERVENTIONS Participating wards were randomly assigned to receive either the nurse led 6-PACK programme or usual care over 12 months. The 6-PACK programme included a fall risk tool and individualised use of one or more of six interventions: ?falls alert? sign, supervision of patients in the bathroom, ensuring patients? walking aids are within reach, a toileting regimen, use of a low-low bed, and use of a bed/chair alarm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The co-primary outcomes were falls and fall injuries per 1000 occupied bed days. RESULTS During the trial, 46 245 admissions to 16 medical and eight surgical wards occurred. As many people were admitted more than once, this represented 31 411 individual patients. Patients? characteristics and length of stay were similar for intervention and control wards. Use of 6-PACK programme components was higher on intervention wards than on control wards (incidence rate ratio 3.05, 95\% confidence interval 2.14 to 4.34; P{\textless}0.001). In all, 1831 falls and 613 fall injuries occurred, and the rates of falls (incidence rate ratio 1.04, 0.78 to 1.37; P=0.796) and fall injuries (0.96, 0.72 to 1.27; P=0.766) were similar in intervention and control wards. CONCLUSIONS Positive changes in falls prevention practice occurred following the introduction of the 6-PACK programme. However, no difference was seen in falls or fall injuries between groups. High quality evidence showing the effectiveness of falls prevention interventions in acute wards remains absent. Novel solutions to the problem of in-hospital falls are urgently needed.

On the basis of these recognitions, this study aimed to identify the patterns of meeting planners' attitudes toward and adoption of technology considering their types of organisations, online and work experience. A mailed survey was sent to a sample of members of Meeting Professionals International and 616 completed questionnaires were received. It was observed that meeting planners' technology adoption varied depending on the type of meeting planners. The results also revealed that meeting planners' online experience acts as an interaction variable for the effect of work experience on the dependent variables such as the usage of online contracts, the usage of online requests for proposal and attitudes toward arranging virtual meetings.},

	abstract = {The adoption of codes of ethics or values statements is intended to guide everyday decisions, as well as to influence the perceptions of external stakeholders. Questions have emerged in the literature about whether the effort to substantively direct decision-making in an organization is marginalized by the more obvious symbolic role of values statements. Here the perceived impact of values statements (defined broadly) on decision-making in organizations is explored, and a number of positive effects observed. Respondents report that values statements create positive externalities providing guidelines for decision-making, increasing accountability, and clarifying expectations. Yet, both cynicism and perceived management hypocrisy emerged in the survey, which together had strong negative effects on the perceived decision-making impact of values statements. Finally, positive external effects (e.g., more symbolic effects) are almost never mentioned by respondents who give their firms high marks on the quality of values statement development, training, and implementation. Yet, such external effects get significantly greater representation in the comments of respondents who report less substance in their firms' values statement development and implementation processes. In all, the results suggest that the substantive and symbolic roles of values statements are not independent and that external symbolism without internal legitimacy may in the long-run be problematic.},

We identified three major phases, planning, implementation, and monitoring, in the restoration process. We found that evaluation occurred both within and between the three phases, that it included both formal and informal components, and that it often had an impact on the performance of the projects. Most evaluations were short-term and only some parts of them were properly documented. Poor or short-term evaluation of the restoration process creates a risk that inefficient methods will continue to be used, which reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration. To improve the restoration process and to transfer the knowledge to future projects, we argue for more formal, sustained evaluation procedures, involving all relevant stakeholders, and increased and improved documentation and dissemination of the results.},

Our first study explores the concept of organizational disidentification through a qualitative investigation of cognitive relationships with the National Rifle Association (NRA). Findings suggest that organizational disidentification is a self-perception based on: (1) a cognitive separation between one's identity and the organization's identity, and (2) a negative relational categorization of oneself and the organization (e.g., categorizations such as "rivals" or "enemies"). Organizational disidentification appears to be motivated by individuals' desires to both affirm positive distinctiveness and avoid negative distinctiveness by distancing themselves from incongruent values and negative stereotypes attributed to an organization. Our findings also suggest that organizational disidentification can lead individuals to take action (either volunteer work or voicing their opinion) as a result of their perceived separation from the organization's identity. Results of our second study-a large-scale survey of public attitudes about the NRA-provide support for this framework.},

Cost–benefit analyses have have used successfully as a conservation tool to identify sites that provide the greatest conservation benefit per unit cost. Our goal was to apply cost–benefit analysis to the question of how to prioritize land management efforts, in our case the application of prescribed fire to natural landscapes in Wisconsin, USA. We quantified and mapped frequently burned communities and prioritized management units based on a suite of indices that captured ecological benefits, management effort, and the feasibility of successful long-term management actions. Data for these indices came from LANDFIRE, Wisconsin's Wildlife Action Plan, and a nationwide wildland–urban interface assessment. We found that the majority of frequently burned vegetation types occurred in the southern portion of the state. However, the highest priority areas for applying prescribed fire occurred in the central, northwest, and northeast portion of the state where frequently burned vegetation patches were larger and where identified areas of high biological importance area occurred. Although our focus was on the use of prescribed fire in Wisconsin, our methods can be adapted to prioritize other land management activities. Such prioritization is necessary to achieve the greatest possible benefits from limited funding for land management actions, and our results show that it is feasible at scales that are relevant for land management decisions.},

	abstract = {Economic explanations of mergers and acquisitions tend to focus on issues of efficiency and strategic fit. When acquisitions fail, economic arguments tend to dominate the reasoning and explanations. While cohesive theory exists, empirical studies of acquisitions and divestitures of failed acquisitions based upon economic models are inconsistent and have poor explanatory power to identify clear success or failure factors. Non-economic explanations, on the other hand, generally lack an integration that goes much beyond suggesting that non-economic differences create integration problems and cannot explain why the economic synergies that organizations hope for often fail to materialize. In an attempt to address these challenges, we draw upon the stepfamily literature to propose several new concepts that provide insights into the factors that influence the success of acquisition execution and implementation. Since diversified corporations bear a striking resemblance to human stepfamilies, stepfamily theory can provide new managerial insights and prescriptions. Three main perspectives frame our view of merger and acquisition success: Biological Discrimination, Incomplete Institutionalization, and Deficit-Comparison. From these perspectives, we propose important factors and characteristics that can influence the ultimate success or failure of a merger or acquisition. From this metaphor, we provide managerial prescriptions for firms engaged in merger and acquisition activities to improve the probability for ultimate success.},

Change catalysis means that implementation is an occasion for rethinking the way the organization does business and an opportunity to introduce additional new practices and to innovate. A total of 1150 facilities belonging to 885 companies that implemented the worldwide quality standard ISO 9000 participated in this study. Results demonstrate that the effects of implementation of this administrative innovation on performance are curvilinear; both too little and too much implementation have a negative effect on performance. The two learning mechanisms moderate the relationship between implementation of the administrative innovation and subsequent performance, such that implementation is associated with higher performance when adaptation-in-use and change catalysis are high rather than low.},
